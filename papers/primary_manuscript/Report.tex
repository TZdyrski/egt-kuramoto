\abstract{
  We extend the evolutionary Kuramoto model of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
  by introducing an asymmetry between communicator and non-communicator payoffs
  as well as placing the players on structured interaction and reproduction graphs.
  We apply the model to the \glsfmtshort{celegans} brain connectome
  to investigate how well the evolutionary oscillators can model synchronicity of the brain.
  We then simulate the populations' evolution across a variety of parameter regimes.
  These results show that weighted interaction graphs,
  including the \glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome,
  serve to decrease the overall communicativeness of the population.
  Additionally, varying the payoff asymmetry changes the types
  of games the individual players play.
  Finally, we find chimeric states in the \glsfmtshort{celegans} case
  which suggests potential connections to previous findings
  of chimera populations in human brains.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Impact of structure on game evolution}
Evolutionary game theory is the application of evolutionary fitness dynamics
to population of players with fixed strategies playing repeated games.
This tool is particularly well-suited to studying how microscopic interaction rules
give rise to macroscopic population patterns such as cooperation
and has found use from international politics and ecology
to protein folding~\citep[\cf{}][and references therein]{traulsen2023future}.
Evolutionary \emph{graph} theory places evolutionary game theory
on graphs to investigate the role of structure on population evolution.
Numerous studies have found that introduction structure
can qualitatively change the population's evolution.
For instance, cooperation can be enhanced by
decreasing the average number of edges~\citep{ohtsuki2006simple},
or having an intermediate proportion
of unidirectional edges~\citep{su2022evolution},
while cooperation is suppressed
for weighted graphs~\citep{bhaumik2024constant}.
Thus, the complex influences of
incompleteness, directedness, and weightedness combine
to enrich the variety of outcomes for evolving populations.

\subsection{Evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics}
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is a tool that extends traditional game theory
to support populations of non-rational players to understand
how populations approach equilibria~\citep{weibull1997evolutionary}.
EGT has proven particularly useful in the study
of cooperation~\citep[\eg{}][and sources therein]{sigmund1999evolutionary}.
Previously, \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} created an EGT model
to capture the behaviour of sinusoidally coupled (\ie{} Kuramoto) oscillators
using game-theoretic approaches.
This model allowed them to investigate how cooperation might arise
amongst collections of communicative and non-communicative neurons
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Though permanent cells such as neurons don't reproduce,
the activation features (\ie{} strategies) can still
be studied with \emph{evolutionary} game theory
if learning is treated as
an evolutionary process~\citep{cohen2009evolutionary}.
This evolutionary Kuramoto model
supplemented the usual communicative/non-communicative
strategy pair with an independent dimension representing the player's ``phase''.
\Citet{tripp2022evolutionary} assumed a well-mixed model of players
on a complete graph, and the players' payoffs were modulated
by a sinusoidal-dependence on their relative phases,
representing the classic Kuramoto oscillator coupling.
This study showed the emergence of various communicative (C)
and non-communicative (N) regimes depending on the relative sizes
of the joint CC benefit $B_0$, the mixed CN/NC benefit $\beta_0$,
and the cost $c$ imposed on communicators.

\subsection{Chimera states}
One intriguing aspect of neurons oscillations
is the observation of chimera states~\citep
[\eg{}][and references therein]{majhi2019chimera}.
These states exhibit the simultaneous existence
of coherent and incoherent phases~\citep{abrams2004chimera}.
These chimera states have been proposed
as a key component of human cognitive organization~\citep{bansal2019cognitive},
a facilitator of spiking and bursting phases~\citep{santos2017chimera},
and an outcome of modular networks~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Despite the observed importance of these chimera states,
the facts that give rise to coherent/incoherent coexistence
remain incompletely characterized.

\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome}
The nematode \gls{celegans}
is a model organism for neuronal studies due to
its relatively simple brain connectome~\citep{cook2019whole}.
With a connectome containing just \num{302} neurons,
the hermaphroditic \gls{celegans} is far more tractable to study
than the nearly \num{100e9} neurons
in the human brain~\citep[\eg][]{von2016search}.
Despite their simplicity, models of the \gls{celegans} brain
still display a wide array of complex phenomena including
topologically-central rich clubs
crucial to motor neurons~\citep{towlson2013rich},
phenomenological connections to control theory~\citep{yan2017network},
and chimeric states~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Therefore, this work will investigate the applicability
of evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics to the \gls{celegans}
connectome model.

\subsection{Outline}
In this paper,we will generalize
the Evolutionary Kuramoto (EK) model
of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} with an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We will also apply this model to incomplete, directed, and weighted graphs.
These generalization will allow us to apply the EK model
to the \gls{celegans} connectome
and analyze its communicativeness properties.
\Cref{sec:game_setup} will outline the setup of the game that neurons play.
In \cref{sec:pop_setup}, we describe the different types
of graphs we will analyze.
Then, we lay out the evolutionary rules for updating the population
in \cref{sec:evo_setup}.
We define the various statistics collected in \cref{sec:stats_setup},
and we describe the analytic results of applying our model
to some of the simpler graphs in \cref{sec:analytic}.
We will present the results of these simulations for
complete graphs (\cref{sec:complete_graph}),
structured graphs (\cref{sec:structured_graph}),
random graphs (\cref{sec:random_graph}),
and the \gls{celegans} connectome (\cref{sec:elegans_graph}).
Finally, \cref{sec:discussion} will be used
for discussing the role of the EK generalizations
and its implications for \gls{celegans} brain structure.

\section{Methods and models}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Game setup}
\label{sec:game_setup}
Here, we use an extension of the Kuramoto game from \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
as a model for evolving, coupled oscillators.
We discretize the $2\pi$ phase angle into $m$ discrete phases $2 \pi j/m$
for $j \in 0 \ldots m-1$.
The game's strategy space is the outer product of the $m$ phases and $2$ communicative choices,
communicative $C$ and non-communicative $N$.
For a given pair of phases, $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$, the game is specified
by the payoff matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-col,first-row,hvlines]
  & C, \phi_j & N, \phi_j \\
  C, \phi_i & B_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c & 2 \alpha \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c \\
  N, \phi_i & (1 - 2\alpha) \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) & 0
\end{bNiceMatrix}
\end{equation}
with $f(\Delta \phi) = [1-\cos(\phi_j - \phi_i)]/2$.
Here, $B_0$, $\beta_0$, $\alpha$, and $c$ are fixed parameters
defining the game.
The cost $c$ represents the penalty paid by communicative players,
and $B_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the in-phase benefits paid with exactly
two or one communicative player, respectively.
The phase-dependent function $f(\Delta \phi)$ encodes
the influence of phase mismatches.
Finally, the benefit asymmetry $\alpha \in [0,1]$ breaks the symmetry
between the payoff for the communicator and the non-communicator
when exactly one player is communicative.

\subsection{Population setup}
\label{sec:pop_setup}
In this study, we consider a collection of different population graphs
to highlight the role of structure on communicativeness.
Given $N$ players, associate a pair
of weighted, directed graphs to the population.
First, we use an interaction graph with $N$ nodes representing players
and edges representing games between players;
here, the direction shows which player receives the payoff
scaled by the edge-weight.
Second, we implement a reproduction graph with the $N$ nodes
still representing players
but the edges now corresponding to ability of nodes to replace one another;
specifically, the tail node may replace the head node,
and its fitness is scaled by the edge weight.
For simplicity, our reproduction graphs are identical to the interaction graph
with a single self-loop added to each node.
These self-loops are necessary in the reproduction graph
to ensure that each node has positive indegree
as required by the Moran process described in the next section.

\subsection{Birth-death Moran process}
\label{sec:evo_setup}
The population is updated according to a birth-death Moran process
with exponential fitness.
On each turn, the following steps are performed.
First a game is played for each edge $j$ in the interaction graph,
each payoff $\pi_j$ is scaled by the edge weight $w_j$,
and the relevant payoff $w_j \pi_j$ is awarded to the head node only.
The total fitness for node $i$ is the exponential of the product
between the selection strength $\delta$
and the sum of all payoffs to node $i$,
or $f_i = \exp(\delta \sum_j w_j \pi_j)$ with the sum
over all edges inwardly incident to node $i$.
Then, a single focal node is chosen for reproduction
with probability proportional to the node's fitness $f_i$.
Finally, a node is chosen for replacement amongst the birth node's outneighbors
with probability proportional to the reproduction graph's edge weight.
With mutation probability $\mu$,
the death node is replaced by a player with a uniformly random strategy;
otherwise, it is replaced by a player with the same strategy as the birth node.
This birth-death process is repeated for each turn.

\subsection{Statistics collected}
\label{sec:stats_setup}
\textbf{TODO: finish this}

\subsection{Cooperative fraction: analytic}
\label{sec:analytic}
Here, our fitness function $f_E$ of strategy $E$ depends
on the total payoff (as opposed to the average payoff) as
\begin{equation}
  f_E = \exp(\delta n_{\text{in}} \pi_E)
\end{equation}
where $\pi_E$ is the (in-degree averaged) \emph{mean} payoff
(as used in \cite{tripp2022evolutionary})
and $n_{\text{in}}$ is the in-degree of the node.

\textbf{TODO: finish this}

While the above derivation applies to the complete graph
of the well-mixed population,
we are also interested in studying non-complete graphs.
Therefore, as a heuristic for translating \cref{eq:full_analytic}
to non-complete graphs,
we will replace the indegree $N-1$ with the average indegree of the graph
$N-1 \to \overline{d}_{\text{in}}$.
For reference, this is \num{19} for the well-mixed case with $N=20$ players
and \num{13.36} for the \gls{celegans} case.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Complete graphs}
\label{sec:complete_graph}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/multi-comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B(0)$
    for different values of the payoff asymmetry $\alpha$.
    The network topology is the
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    the $B(0)$ step size is \num{0.04},
    and the simulation was run for \num{2E8} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:multi-comm-frac}
\end{figure}

First, we will explore the influence of the newly introduced asymmetry
on the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac}, we re-analyze the $N=20$ well-mixed population
originally analyzed in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
There, we compare the frequency of communicative strategies, $f_{\text{comm}}$,
to the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B(0)$.
The $\alpha=1/2$ case corresponds to, and reproduces,
the \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} setup.
We can see it has low $f_{\text{comm}}$ for small $B(0)$,
rises to $f_{\text{comm}} = 1/2$ at $B(0) \approx 0.21$
(corresponding to the $B(0) = 2 (N-1) c/(N-2)$ condition
found by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}),
and plateaus to $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 1$ for large $B(0)$.
We also see that increasing (decreasing)
the asymmetry $\alpha$ dilates (stretches) this sigmoid function
in the $B(0)$ direction.
In particular, for the smaller $\alpha$'s, the $f_{\text{comm}}$ curve
rises more steeply and at smaller values of $B(0)$.

\subsection{Structured graphs}
\label{sec:structured_graph}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For the strong-selection case ($B_0 = 2.5c$ and $\delta = 5$
    with $t_{\text{step}} = \num{2e4}$):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The weightedness has virtually no effect
    \item The directionality generally enhances cooperation
      and suppresses the order parameter to approximately
      \num{0.5} each
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The one exception case is $\alpha = \num{0.25}$ where a
        chicken-type game with relatively high order parameter
        (\num{0.7}) and low cooperation (\num{0.3}) change to a
        deadlock-type game with medium order parameter and cooperation
        (approximately \num{0.5} each)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item For the weak-selection case ($B_0 = 1.5c$ and $\delta = 0.2$) with
  $t_{\text{step}} = \num{2e4}$), things change dramatically
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Random graphs}
\label{sec:random_graph}
\subsubsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans}}
\label{sec:elegans_graph}

\begin{figure}

  \input{tikz/comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B(0)$.
    The blue dots represent the simulation results,
    the solid orange line represents the full $k$-regular, analytic estimate,
    and the dashed red line represents the small-$B(0)$ $k$-regular approximation.

    and the simulation was run for \num{2E8} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:comm-frac}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:comm-frac} shows the fraction of players
using communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaged across
the entire simulation of \num{2E8} time steps as a function
of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B(0)$.
These plots shows the fraction for the
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}
$N=20$ well-mixed and
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.
In addition, two variants of the full weighted, directed \gls{celegans}
connectome are shown:
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted} \emph{directed} but unweighted case
and
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected} \emph{weighted} but undirected case.
The plots used a selection strength of $\delta=0.2$
and an asymmetry of $\alpha=3/4$.
The blue dots represent the numerical simulation results across eleven
values of $B(0)$.
The solid orange line represents the full analytic
result (\pcref{eq:full_analytic}) for a well-mixed population
with the well-mixed indegree $n-1$ replaced by the average
indegree: \num{19} for the well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
and \num{13.36} for the \gls{celegans} cases
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}--\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}.
Finally, the red dotted line represents the first term
of the analytic result~(\pcref{eq:analytic_first_term}).

The well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed} shows a logistic curve
qualitatively similar to that shown in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
While the \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} case ($\alpha = 1/2$)
crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ near $B(0) = 0.21$,
the plot here (with $\alpha = 3/4$) is compressed to the $y$-axis
and crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ around $B(0) = 0.12$.
However, the \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
is qualitatively distinct.
Here, we see that population is nearly universally non-communicative
for $B(0) \le 0.08$,
followed by an immediate jump to a maximum communicative fraction
of \num{0.77} around $B(0) = 1.6$.
This communicative fraction then slowly declines
to a horizontal asymptote around \num{0.60}.
While the orang line representing the analytic result
is a nearly perfect match for the well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
the \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} deviates significantly
from the simulation results.

In order to investigate the cause of the deviation
between simulation and theory
in the full \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full},
we next look at variations to the \gls{celegans} network topology.
First, the \emph{directed}, unweighted connectome
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted}
is qualitatively similar to the well-mixed case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}.
While the blue simulation results exhibit a steeper rise
than the orange theory results,
the directed case still shows a monotonic increase
from low communication for $B(0) < 0.1$
to full communication for $B(0) \ge 0.2$.
This implies that the quality of directedness
plays a relatively small role in the qualitative shape
of the full \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}.
On the other hand,
the \emph{weighted}, undirected connectome
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
looks quite similar to the full \gls{celegans} case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}.
In particular, this weighted case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
shows the same plateau at $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 0.7$
seen in the full \gls{celegans} case,
though the ``peak'' around $B(0) - 0.15$ is less pronounced.
This similarity implies that the connectome's edge weights
are the most relevant aspect influencing the deviation
of the \gls{celegans} \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
simulation results in blue from the theory results in orange.

\subsubsection{Game types}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/game-types.tikz}
  \caption{
    The most common game type amongst all player interactions
    (given by the interaction graph edge weight),
    expressed as a fraction of all games played,
    for different values of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
    The game types are color-coded according to the legend.
    The network topology is the
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed}}
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}}
    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    $B(0)$ is \num{1.5},
    and the simulation was run for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:game-type}
\end{figure}

Next, we would like to understand the types of games being played
during the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:game-type}, we consider the most common game type
amongst all player interactions.
Note that a player pair's game type is determined solely
by their relative phase $\Delta \phi$ and is independent
of the players' communicativeness, by definition.
At each time step, we determine the most common game types
across all player interactions,
where the number of interactions between two players
is the corresponding edge weight of the interaction graph.
Finally, \cref{fig:game-type} shows what fraction of time
a given game type is the plurality for different values
of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
\Cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
shows the fraction for the
$N=20$ well-mixed,
and
\cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.

\Cref{fig:game-type} shows qualitative differences
between the different network topologies.
The \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the time evolution for each asymmetry $\alpha$
is dominated by a single game type
occurring for over \SI{99.9}{\percent} of the time steps.
This is in contrast with the
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} connectome case,
where the deadlock type game is most common
for \SIrange{10}{15}{\percent} of the time steps
for asymmetry $\alpha \le 0.5$.
Nevertheless, both \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed
and \subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} have the same dominant game types
across asymmetries:
dilemma for $\alpha = 0, 0.25$, chicken for $\alpha = 0.5$,
hero for $\alpha = 0.75$, and $deadlock for \alpha = 1$.
This shows that, as the asymmetry is varied,
different game types dominate the population's evolution
and network topology influences how dominant these game types are.

\subsubsection{Time series}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/time-series.tikz}
  \caption{
    The left vertical axis of each subplot depicts a scatter plot of
    the instantaneous fraction of players that are communicative
    as a function of time.
    These points are color-coded
    grey if all players are communicative or
    black if all players are non-communicative;
    otherwise, they are colored according
    to the plurality game type as indicated in the legend.
    The right vertical axis depicts the order parameter $r$
    (\pcref{eq:order_parameter}) in magenta as a function of time.
    The network topology is the
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed}}
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}}
    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    $B(0)$ is \num{0.15},
    and the simulation was run for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:time-series}
\end{figure}

While \cref{fig:comm-frac,fig:game-type} displayed
the time-averaged system state,
it is also useful to investigate the time-dependent variations.
As before, \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} shows the results
for a well-mixed population of $N=20$ players
while \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} depicts the results
for the \gls{celegans} connectome.
\Cref{fig:time-series} depicts the frequency
of communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$
as a scatter plot of time on the left vertical axis.
These time-series points are color-coded
grey if all players are communicative or
black if all players are non-communicative;
otherwise, the points are colored according
to the plurality game type as indicated in the legend.
On the right vertical axis,
a magenta line plot depicts the order parameter
given by
\begin{equation}
  r = \frac{1}{N} \abs{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{\im \phi_j}}
  \label{eq:order_parameter}
\end{equation}
taking values in the range $[0,1]$,
where $\phi_j$ is the phase of the $j$-th player.
These simulations were run with
for \num{8E6} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
asymmetry $\alpha = 3/4$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
and maximum benefit of mutual communication $B(0) = 0.15$.

The \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the system incredibly homogeneous.
Temporary drops in communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$
and order parameter $r$ are likely the result of mutations,
which are expected to occur, on average, every $1/\mu = \num{1E4}$ time steps.
But the system quickly returns to uniformity;
for the parameters and timespan depicted here,
the system spends a majority of its time in the communicative regime.
Indeed, as shown in \cref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
this simulation with $B(0) = 0.15$ should be be in the communicative regime
approximately \SI{75}{\percent} of the time.
In contrast, the \subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
depicts a far more heterogeneous population.
Here, the population never stabilizes to fully communicative or non-communicative.
Instead, both its communicative frequency and order parameter
stay between \SIrange{40}{70}{\percent}.
With a communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaging approximately \SI{60}{\percent},
this is similar to the $f_{\text{comm}} \approx \SI{70}{\percent}$ seen
in \cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} with $B(0) = 0.15$.
The difference is reflective of this particular \num{8E6} subset
of the \num{2E8} runtime in \cref{fig:comm-frac}.
While the \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
the \gls{celegans} case shows less stability to mutations.
Instead of the uniform player communicatively interrupted
impulsive disturbances,
the \gls{celegans} case depicts heterogeneous communicativeness
with occasional, discontinuous jumps.
Again, these are most likely the results of mutations introduced
to the population.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we extended the evolutionary Kuramoto model
introduced by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to include structured interaction and reproduction graphs
as well as an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We first applied this model to a well-mixed population
and found that increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry
inhibits (promotes) communicativity.
Next, we applied the model to
a family of graphs deriving from the \gls{celegans} connectome,
including: the full directed, weighted graph;
an unweighted, directed graph;
and an undirected, weighted graph.
This revealed that the graph's directedness
had a minor effect of steepening the transition
from non-communicative to communicative
as the maximum benefit of mutual communication was increased.
However, the weightedness of the graph had a much more drastic effect
on the population by strongly suppressing the maximum communicativity.
For the weighted connectome graphs (both directed and undirected),
the communicative frequency asymptote decreased from unity
to approximately \num{0.7} for large $B(0)$.
Finally, we found qualitative differences between the composition
of the well-mixed populations and the \gls{celegans} populations.
While the well-mixed players had largely homogeneous populations
that occasionally switched between fully communicative
and fully non communicative,
the \gls{celegans} population remained far more heterogenous
with a stable, chimeric mix of both communicators and non-communicators.
This chimera state in a model of the \gls{celegans} brain connectome
was suggestive of prior studies finding chimera states in human brains.
Potential avenues of future research include applying the model
to larger connectomes such as that
of \gls{dmelanogaster}~\citep{schlegel2024whole}.
Additionally, it could prove fruitful to analytically study
the dynamics of game types as a function of the payoff asymmetry
to better understand any long-run attractor game types.
