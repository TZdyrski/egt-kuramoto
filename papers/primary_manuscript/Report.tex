\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{C.\ Elegans}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Weighted (connectome) vs.\ unweighted (connectome w/o
      weights): weighting reduces synchronization
    \item Connectome is connected, weighted, directed cyclic graph
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Therefore, \emph{cannot} directly use
        \textcite{allen2017evolutionary}, since it only applies to undirected
        graphs
    \end{itemize}
    \item Low selection strength ($0.005$) keeps mostly around synchronicity
      $\approx 1.0$, with a small break to 0.8 \emph{before} $B_{\text{crit}}$
    \item High selection strength ($0.2$) has low synchronicity
      ($\approx 0.0$) before $B_{\text{crit}}$ but increases (at roughly
      $B_{\text{crit}}$) to $\approx 0.5$
    \item Hence, it seems that
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Neither low nor high selection strength corresponds to
        well-mixed case
      \item Low and high selection strengths do not appear to be simple
        stretching about $B_{\text{crit}}$ as in the well-mixed case
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\section{Results}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Note: for c-elegans, $B_{\text{factor}} = 1.5$, $2E6$ timesteps,
    $\delta = 2$, $\mu = 0.2$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We can calculate the average number of communicative at each
      time step and calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient of
      this number against each node's communicative state
    \item We find that the maximum correlation is \num{0.41}, mean
      correlation is \num{0.03}, std correlation is \num{0.06}. That
      is, there are a few outliers with high correlation
    \item Unfortunately, these are \emph{not} the premotor neurons
      (all had correlation $\approx \num{0.1}$)
    \item Instead, the ones with correlation above \num{0.35} were
      indices 101, 117, 211, and 219 (IL1L, AUAL, SMBDL, and SIADL)
  \end{itemize}
  \item General trends of c-elegans up to $T = 2E8$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For strong forcing $\delta = 0.2$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Undirected and unweighted looks like a spread-out, symmetric
        version of well-mixed
      \item Adding weights suppresses communication, lowering ceiling
        for fraction of communication from \num{1} to \num{0.8}
      \item Adding directedness introduces strange staircase-like shape
        and slightly depresses ceiling from \num{1} to \num{0.9}
      \item Full weighted, directed version shows both staircase-like
        shape and strongly suppressed ceiling to \num{0.6}
    \end{itemize}
    \item For weak forcing $\delta = 0.005$:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Undirected and unweighted has strange staricase-like shape
      \item Adding weights sharpens jump around $B_\text{crit}$, nearly
        matching well-mixed case
      \item Adding directedness strongly supresses seleciton, with
        ceiling and floor compressed to the range $[0.3,0.6]$
      \item Full weighted, directed version shows strange, non-monotonic
        behavior. More investigation is needed
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
