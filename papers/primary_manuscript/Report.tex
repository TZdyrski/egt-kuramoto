\abstract{
  We extend the evolutionary Kuramoto model of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
  by introducing an asymmetry between communicator and non-communicator payoffs
  as well as placing the players on structured graphs.
  We apply the model to the \glsfmtshort{celegans} brain connectome
  to investigate how well the evolutionary oscillators can model synchronicity in the brain.
  We then simulate the populations' evolution across a variety of parameter regimes.
  These results show that weighted interaction graphs,
  including the \glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome,
  serve to decrease the overall communicativeness of the population.
  Additionally, varying the payoff asymmetry changes the types
  of games the individual players play.
  Finally, we find chimera states in the \glsfmtshort{celegans} case
  which suggests potential connections to previous findings
  of chimera populations in human brains.

%\section{Introduction}
%\subsection{Impact of structure on game evolution}
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application
of evolutionary fitness dynamics
to populations of non-rational players with fixed strategies playing repeated games.
This tool is particularly well-suited to studying how microscopic interaction rules
give rise to macroscopic population patterns
such as cooperation~\citep[\eg{}][and sources therein]{sigmund1999evolutionary}
and has been applied to fields from international politics to ecology
to protein folding~\citep[\cf{}][and references therein]{traulsen2023future}.
Evolutionary \emph{graph} theory places evolutionary game theory
on graphs to investigate the role of structure on population evolution.
Numerous studies have found that introduction structure
can qualitatively change the population's evolution.
For instance, cooperation can be enhanced by
decreasing the average number of edges~\citep{ohtsuki2006simple},
or having an intermediate proportion
of unidirectional edges~\citep{su2022evolution},
while cooperation is suppressed
for weighted graphs~\citep{bhaumik2024constant}.
Thus, the complex influences of
incompleteness, directedness, and weightedness combine
to enrich the variety of outcomes for evolving populations.

%\subsection{Evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics}
Previously, \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} created an EGT model
to capture the behaviour of sinusoidally coupled (\ie{} Kuramoto) oscillators
using game-theoretic approaches.
This model allowed them to investigate how cooperation might arise
amongst collections of communicative and non-communicative neurons
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Though permanent cells such as neurons don't reproduce,
the activation features (\ie{} strategies) can still
be studied with evolutionary game theory
if learning is treated as
an evolutionary process~\citep{cohen2009evolutionary}.
This evolutionary Kuramoto model
supplemented the usual communicative/non-communicative
strategy pair with an independent dimension representing the player's ``phase''.
\Citet{tripp2022evolutionary} assumed a well-mixed model of players
on a complete graph, and the players' payoffs were modulated
by a sinusoidal-dependence on their relative phases,
representing the classic Kuramoto oscillator coupling.
This study showed the emergence of various communicative (C)
and non-communicative (N) regimes depending on the relative sizes
of the joint CC benefit $B_0$, the mixed CN/NC benefit $\beta_0$,
and the cost $c$ imposed on communicators.

%\subsection{Chimera states}
One intriguing aspect of neuron oscillations
is the observation of chimera states~\citep
[\eg{}][and references therein]{majhi2019chimera}.
These states exhibit the simultaneous existence
of coherent and incoherent phases~\citep{abrams2004chimera}.
Chimera states have been proposed
as a key component of human cognitive organization~\citep{bansal2019cognitive},
a facilitator of spiking and bursting phases~\citep{santos2017chimera},
and an outcome of modular networks~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Despite the observed importance of these chimera states,
the factors that give rise to coherent/incoherent coexistence
remain incompletely characterized.

%\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome}
The nematode \gls{celegans}
is a model organism in neuroscience due to
its relatively simple brain connectome~\citep{cook2019whole}.
With a connectome containing just \num{302} neurons,
the hermaphroditic \gls{celegans} is far more tractable to study
than the nearly \num{100e9} neurons
in the human brain~\citep[\eg][]{von2016search}.
Despite their simplicity, models of the \gls{celegans} brain
still display a wide array of complex phenomena including
topologically-central rich clubs
crucial to motor neurons~\citep{towlson2013rich},
phenomenological connections to control theory~\citep{yan2017network},
and chimera states~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Therefore, this work will investigate the applicability
of evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics to the \gls{celegans}
connectome model.

%\subsection{Outline}
In this paper,we will generalize
the Evolutionary Kuramoto (EK) model
of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} with an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We will also apply this model to incomplete, directed, and weighted graphs.
These generalization will allow us to apply the EK model
to the \gls{celegans} connectome
and analyze its communicativeness properties.
\Cref{sec:game_setup} will outline the setup of the game that neurons play.
In \cref{sec:pop_setup}, we describe the different types
of graphs we will analyze.
Then, we lay out the evolutionary rules for updating the population
in \cref{sec:evo_setup}.
We define the various statistics collected in \cref{sec:stats_setup}.
We will present the results of these simulations for
complete graphs (\cref{sec:complete_graph})
and the \gls{celegans} connectome (\cref{sec:elegans_graph}).
Finally, \cref{sec:discussion} will be used
for discussing the role of the EK generalizations
and its implications for \gls{celegans} brain structure.

\section{Methods and models}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Game setup}
\label{sec:game_setup}
Here, we use an extension of the EK game from \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
as a model for evolving, coupled oscillators.
We discretize the $2\pi$ phase angle into $m=20$ discrete phases $2 \pi j/m$
for $j \in 0, \ldots, m-1$.
The game's strategy space is the outer product of the $m$ phases and $2$ communicative choices,
communicative $C$ and non-communicative $N$.
For a given pair of phases, $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$, the game is specified
by the payoff matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-col,first-row,hvlines]
  & C, \phi_j & N, \phi_j \\
  C, \phi_i & B_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c & 2 \alpha \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c \\
  N, \phi_i & 2 (1 - \alpha) \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) & 0
\end{bNiceMatrix}
\label{eq:payoff-matrix}
\end{equation}
with $f(\Delta \phi) = [1+\cos(\phi_j - \phi_i)]/2$.
Here, $B_0$, $\beta_0$, $\alpha$, and $c$ are fixed parameters
defining the game.
The cost $c$ represents the penalty paid by communicative players,
and $B_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the maximum benefits paid with
joint CC communicators and mixed CN players, respectively.
The phase-dependent function $f(\Delta \phi)$ encodes
the influence of phase mismatches.
Finally, the benefit asymmetry $\alpha \in [0,1]$ breaks the symmetry
between the payoff for the communicator and the non-communicator
when exactly one player is communicative.

\subsection{Population setup}
\label{sec:pop_setup}
In this study, we consider a collection of different population graphs
to highlight the role of structure on communicativeness.
Given $N$ players, associate a pair
of weighted, directed graphs to the population.
First, we use an interaction graph with $N$ nodes representing players
and weighted, directed edges representing games between players.
Second, we implement a reproduction graph with the $N$ nodes
still representing players
but the edges now corresponding to the ability of nodes to replace one another.
For simplicity, our reproduction graphs are identical to the interaction graph
with a single self-loop added to each node.
These self-loops are necessary in the reproduction graph
to ensure that each node has positive indegree
as required by the Moran process described in the next section.

\subsection{Birth-death Moran process}
\label{sec:evo_setup}
The population is updated according to a birth-death Moran process
with exponential fitness~\citep[\eg \cf][]{lieberman2005evolutionary}.
On each turn, the following steps are performed.
First, a game is played on each edge $j$ in the interaction graph,
each edge's payoff $\pi_j$ is scaled by the edge weight $w_j$,
and the relevant payoff $w_j \pi_j$ is awarded to the head node only.
The total fitness for node $i$ is the exponential of the product
between the selection strength $\delta$
and the sum of payoffs to node $i$,
or $f_i = \exp(\delta \sum_j w_j \pi_j)$ with the sum
over all edges inwardly incident to node $i$.
Then, a single focal node is chosen for reproduction
with probability proportional to the node's fitness $f_i$.
Finally, a node is chosen for replacement amongst the birth node's outneighbors
with probability proportional to the reproduction graph's edge weight.
With mutation probability $\mu$,
the death node is replaced by a player with a uniformly random strategy;
otherwise, it is replaced by a player with the same strategy as the birth node.
This birth-death process is repeated for each turn.

\subsection{Statistics collected}
\label{sec:stats_setup}
A variety of statistics will be used to quantify the evolution
of the games' populations.
First, we determine the frequency of communicative strategies
$f_{\text{comm}}$ as the fraction of players employing
a communicative strategy $C$ at a given time step.
We are also interested in defining the time-averaged communicative frequency
by averaging $f_{\text{comm}}$ over the entire simulation;
for simulation times long compared to the mutation turnover time
$T_{\text{turn}} \gg N/\mu$,
the initial, random distribution of strategies will be negligible
and the time-average will correspond to the long-time limit.

We are interested in comparing the $f_{\text{comm}}$ simulation results
to an analytic model.
In the appendix, we analytically extend the work of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to account for benefit asymmetry $\alpha$.
The resulting communicative fraction \cref{eq:full_analytic}
is derived for the well-mixed case.
To apply \cref{eq:full_analytic} to non-complete graphs such as
the \gls{celegans} connectome,
we replace the indegree $N-1$ with the average indegree of the graph
$N-1 \to \overline{d}_{\text{in}}$.
Note that $\overline{d}_{\text{in}} = \num{19}$
for the well-mixed case with $N=20$ players
and $\overline{d}_{\text{in}} = \num{12.36}$ for the \gls{celegans} case.

During the game's evolution,
each pair of connected players will be playing a variety of game types
such as deadlock, dilemma, chicken, \etc{}
\citep[\cf{}][for definitions]{bruns2015names}.
We will analyze the types of games being played by
identifying the most common game type across all player interactions,
weighted by the interaction graph edge weights,
at each time step.
Then, we calculate the frequency of this ``most common game'' across
all time steps of a given simulation to determine the distribution
of games commonly played.
Note that a player pair's game type is determined solely
by their relative phase $\Delta \phi$ and is independent
of the players' communicativeness.
Furthermore, this metric is only sensitive to the
plurality game and therefore provides no information
on the presence/absence of minority game types.

Given that this evolutionary game model was inspired
by the Kuramoto system of coupled oscillators,
we will also use the standard Kuramoto order parameter:
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{1}{N} \abs{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{\im \phi_j}}
  \label{eq:order_parameter}
\end{equation}
This parameter ranges from zero to one, inclusive,
and represents how coherent the population is,
with $\rho = 1$ for completely coherent and $\rho = 0$ completely incoherent.

Finally, we need a way to quantify
the chimera-like quality of the population.
To compare with the analysis of \citet{hizanidis2016chimera},
we will utilize a pair of indices introduced
by \citet{shanahan2010metastable}.
First, we need to organize the game's nodes
into $M$ disjoint communities.
We split the nodes into $M=2$ communities $C_m$
by taking a subset
(the first \num{8E4} steps for computations ease)
of the simulation results
for the \gls{celegans} simulation with asymmetry $\alpha = \num{0.75}$.
We then calculate the covariance matrix $K_{i,j}$ of the strategy indices
(ensuring that communicative ($C$, $\phi_i$)
and non-communicative ($N$, $\phi_i$) are treated distinctly)
and calculate the row-wise covariance-sums  $\sum_i K_{i,j}$.
After finding the node with the maximum covariance-sum
$\cov_{\text{max}} \coloneqq \max_j{\sum_i K_{i,j}}$,
we form a community by collecting all nodes $j$ with covariance-sum
at least \SI{81}{\percent} of the maximum,
$\sum_i K_{i,j} \ge \num{0.81} \cov_{\text{max}}$.
Finally, we place all the remaining nodes in a second community.

With these disjoint communities $C_m$, we then calculate
the time-dependent, community-wise order parameter $\rho_m(t)$
as
\begin{equation}
  \rho_m(t) \coloneqq \frac{1}{N_m} \abs{\sum_{j \in C_m} e^{\im \phi_j}}
\end{equation}
across members $j$ of community $C_m$ with size $N_m$.
Then, we define a chimera-like index $\chi$
\begin{equation}
  \chi = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{chi}}}_T
    \text{\qquad with \qquad}
    \sigma_{\text{chi}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{m=1}^M
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_M}^2
  \label{eq:chimera_index}
\end{equation}
and a metastability index $\lambda$
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{met}}}_M
    \text{\qquad with \qquad}
    \sigma_{\text{met}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_T}^2
  \label{eq:metastability_index}
\end{equation}
across the $M$ communities and $T$ time steps.
The chimera-like index measures the difference in coherence between communities:
complete homogeneity between communities
(\eg{} all fully synchronized \emph{or} fully desynchronized)
corresponds to $\chi = 0$,
while having two equally-sized communities
with one fully synchronized and one fully desynchronized
for all times yields a maximum $\chi = 2/7 \approx
\num{0.29}$~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
Likewise, the metastability index $\lambda$ measures how metastable
the system is (\ie{} transiting between synchronicity and desynchronicity).
A system that is fully synchronized or desynchronized gives $\lambda = 0$,
while spending equal times in each states yields $\lambda = 1/12
\approx \num{0.08}$~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Complete graphs}
\label{sec:complete_graph}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/graph_multi-comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    \protect{\subref{fig:multi-comm-frac}}
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum joint benefit $B_0$
    for different values of the payoff asymmetry $\alpha$.
    The network topologies are the
    $N=20$ well-mixed population,
    the $B_0$ step size is \num{0.04},
    the maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$ at each step,
    and the simulation were run for \num{2E8} time steps.

    The colors represent the $2m = 40$ strategies
    at a particular time step;
    blue colors are communicative,
    red colors are non-communicative,
    and shades represent different phases $\phi$.
    For both cases,
    the selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    and
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1}.
  }
  \label{fig:graph_multi-comm-frac}
\end{figure}

First, we will explore the influence of the newly introduced asymmetry
on the population's evolution by
re-analyzing the $N=20$ well-mixed population
originally analyzed in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
\Cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} compares the frequency of communicative strategies,
$f_{\text{comm}}$, to the maximum joint benefit $B_0$,
and the $\alpha=1/2$ case corresponds to---and reproduces---the
\citet{tripp2022evolutionary} setup.
We can see $f_{\text{comm}}$ is low for small $B_0$,
rises to $f_{\text{comm}} = 1/2$ at $B_0 \approx 0.21$
(corresponding to the $B_0 = 2 (N-1) c/(N-2)$ condition
found by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}),
and plateaus to $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 1$ for large $B_0$.
We also see that increasing (decreasing)
the asymmetry $\alpha$ dilates (stretches) this sigmoid function
in the $B_0$ direction.
In particular, for the smaller $\alpha$'s, the $f_{\text{comm}}$ curve
rises more steeply and at smaller values of $B_0$.

\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} graphs}
\label{sec:elegans_graph}

Here, we consider the weighted, directed hermaphroditic \gls{celegans} connectome.
For reference, \cref{fig:graph} shows the $N = 300$ nodes and the directed edges
(we exclude the two unconnected neurons CANL/CANR).
The nodes are colored according to their strategy at a particular time step,
with blues representing communicative strategies
and reds representing non-communicative ones,
with different shades corresponding to different phases $\phi$.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum joint benefit $B_0$.
    The blue dots represent the simulation results,
    the solid orange line represents the full analytic estimate,
    and the dashed red line represents the small-$B_0$ approximation.
    The network topologies are the
    \protect{\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}}
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    \protect{\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}}
    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome,
    \protect{\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted}}
    unweighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome,
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}}
    weighted, undirected \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    the $B_0$ step size is \num{0.04},
    the maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$ at each step,
    and the simulation were run for \num{2E8} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:comm-frac}
\end{figure}

Next, to quantify the observations of \cref{fig:graph},
\cref{fig:comm-frac} shows the fraction of players
using communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaged across
the entire simulation of \num{2E8} time steps as a function
of the maximum joint benefit $B_0$.
These plots shows the fraction for the
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}
$N=20$ well-mixed and
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.
In addition, two variants of the full weighted, directed \gls{celegans}
connectome are shown:
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted} \emph{directed} but unweighted case
and
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected} \emph{weighted} but undirected case.
The plots used a selection strength of $\delta=0.2$
and an asymmetry of $\alpha=3/4$.
The blue dots represent the numerical simulation results across eleven
values of $B_0$.
The solid orange line represents the full analytic
result (\pcref{eq:full_analytic}) for a well-mixed population
with the well-mixed indegree $n-1$ replaced by the average
indegree: $\overline{d}_{\text{in}} = \num{19}$
for the \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
and $\overline{d}_{\text{in}} = \num{12.36}$ for the
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}--\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
\gls{celegans} cases.
Finally, the red dotted line represents the first term
in the asymptotic expansion
of the analytic result for small $B_0$~(\pcref{eq:analytic_first_term}).

The \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed} well-mixed case shows a logistic curve
qualitatively similar to that shown in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
While the \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} case ($\alpha = 1/2$)
crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ near $B_0 = 0.21$,
the plot here (with $\alpha = 3/4$) is compressed to the $y$-axis
and crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ around $B_0 = 0.12$.
However, the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
is qualitatively distinct.
Here, we see that the population is almost universally non-communicative
for $B_0 \le 0.08$,
followed by an immediate jump to a maximum communicative fraction
of \num{0.77} around $B_0 = 1.6$.
This communicative fraction then slowly declines
to a horizontal asymptote around \num{0.60}.
While the orange line representing the analytic result
is a nearly perfect match for the \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case deviates significantly
from the simulation results.
This deviation implies the \gls{celegans} case
has qualitatively different influences compared to the baseline, well-mixed case.

In order to investigate the cause of the deviation
between simulation and theory
in the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} full \gls{celegans} case,
we next look at variations to the \gls{celegans} network topology.
First, the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted}
\emph{directed}, unweighted connectome
is qualitatively similar to the
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}
well-mixed case :
while the simulation results (blue) exhibit a steeper rise
than the theory results (orange),
the directed case still shows a monotonic increase
from low communicativeness for $B_0 < 0.1$
to full communicativeness for $B_0 \ge 0.2$.
This implies that the quality of directedness
plays a relatively small role in the qualitative shape
of the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} full \gls{celegans} case.
On the other hand,
the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
\emph{weighted}, undirected connectome
looks quite similar to the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
full \gls{celegans} case .
In particular, this \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
weighted case
shows the same plateau at $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 0.7$
seen in the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} full \gls{celegans} case,
though the peak around $B_0 = 0.15$ is less pronounced.
This similarity implies that the connectome's edge weights
are the most relevant aspect influencing the deviation
of the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} \gls{celegans}
simulation results (blue) from the theory results (orange).

\subsubsection{Game types}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/game-types.tikz}
  \caption{

    The network topologies are the
    \protect{\subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}}

    $B_0$ is \num{0.15},
    $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$,
    and the simulation were run for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:game-type}
\end{figure}

Next, we would like to understand the types of games being played
during the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:game-type}, we consider the most common game type
amongst all player interactions~(\cf \cref{sec:stats_setup})
At each time step, we determine the most common game types
across all player interactions,
where the number of interactions between two players
is the corresponding edge weight of the interaction graph.
\Cref{fig:game-type} shows what fraction of time
a given game type is the plurality for different values
of the asymmetry $\alpha$ for
\subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
$N=20$ well-mixed,
and
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome
network topologies.
The \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the time evolution for each asymmetry $\alpha$
is dominated by a single game type
occurring for over \SI{99.9}{\percent} of the time steps.
This is in contrast with the
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} connectome case,
where the deadlock-type game is most common
for \SIrange{10}{15}{\percent} of the time steps
for asymmetry $\alpha \le 0.5$.
Nevertheless, both \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed
and \subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans}
have the same dominant game types
across asymmetries:
dilemma for $\alpha = 0, 0.25$, chicken for $\alpha = 0.5$,
hero for $\alpha = 0.75$, and deadlock for $\alpha = 1$.
This shows that, as the asymmetry is varied,
different game types dominate the population's evolution,
and network topology influences how dominant these game types are.

\subsubsection{Time series}

    the left vertical axis of each subplot gives

    as a function of time.
    These points are color-coded
    grey if all players are communicative or
    black if all players are non-communicative;
    otherwise, they are colored according
    to the plurality game type as indicated in the legend.
    The right vertical axis corresponds to the order parameter $\rho$
    (\pcref{eq:order_parameter}), in magenta, as a function of time.
    The network topologies are the

    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,

    $B_0$ is \num{0.15},
    $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$,
    and the simulation were run for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:time-series}
\end{figure}

While \cref{fig:comm-frac,fig:game-type} displayed
the time-averaged system state,
it is also useful to investigate the time-dependent variations.
\Cref{fig:time-series} depicts the frequency
of communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$
as a scatter plot of time on the left vertical axis.
These time-series points are color-coded
grey if all players are communicative or
black if all players are non-communicative;
otherwise, the points are colored according
to the plurality game type as indicated in the legend.
On the right vertical axis,
a magenta line plot depicts the order parameter
given by \cref{eq:order_parameter} and
taking values in the range $[0,1]$.
As before, \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} shows the results
for a well-mixed population of $N=20$ players
while \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} depicts the results
for the \gls{celegans} connectome.
These simulations were run
for \num{8E6} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
asymmetry $\alpha = 3/4$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
maximum joint benefit $B_0 = 0.15$,
and maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$.

The \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the system is incredibly homogeneous.
Temporary drops in communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$
and order parameter $\rho$ are likely the result of mutations,
which are expected to occur, on average, every $1/\mu = \num{1E4}$ time steps.
But the system quickly returns to uniformity;
for the parameters and time span depicted here,
the system spends a majority of its time in the communicative regime.
Indeed, as shown in \cref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
this simulation with $B_0 = 0.15$ should be be in the communicative regime
approximately \SI{75}{\percent} of the time.
In contrast, the \subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
depicts a far more heterogeneous population.
Here, the population never stabilizes
to a fully communicative or non-communicative state.
Instead, both its communicative frequency and order parameter
stay between \SIrange{40}{70}{\percent}.
With a communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaging approximately \SI{60}{\percent},
this is similar to the $f_{\text{comm}} \approx \SI{70}{\percent}$ seen
in \cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} with $B_0 = 0.15$;
the deviation from \SI{70}{\percent} is reflective of the
stochasticity in this small, \num{8E6} time-step sample.
Compared to the \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
the \gls{celegans} case shows less stability to mutations.
Instead of the homogeneous communicative state with impulse disturbances,
the \gls{celegans} case depicts heterogeneous communicativeness
with interrupted by discontinuous jumps.
Again, these are most likely the results of mutations introduced
to the population.

\subsubsection{Chimera-like index}

  \pgfplotsset{width=0.4\textwidth}
  \input{tikz/chimera-index.tikz}
  \caption{
    The chimera-like index (\pcref{eq:chimera_index}, left axis, solid line)
    and metastability index (\pcref{eq:metastability_index},
    right axis, dashed line)
    as functions of the asymmetry $\alpha$
    for the
    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The indices were calculated after splitting the graph
    into two communities according to the nodes' relative covariance
    for the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ simulation
    and grouped according to whether the sum
    of a node's relative covariances are above
    \SI{81}{\percent} of the maximum covariance sum.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    $B_0$ is \num{0.15},
    $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$,
    and the simulation were run for \num{8E6} time steps.
    Note the differing vertical axis scales
    for the left and right axes.
  }
  \label{fig:chimera-index}
\end{figure}

Time-lapse animations of the system's time evolution
(see supplementary materials)
show a subset of the nodes exhibiting high synchronicity
with others remaining incoherent: this is characteristic of a chimera state.
In order to quantify this effect, we will investigate
the chimera-like index $\chi$ (\pcref{eq:chimera_index})
and metastability index $\lambda$ (\pcref{eq:metastability_index}).
As discussed in \cref{sec:stats_setup},
we first split the players into $M=2$ distinct communities
according to the row-wise sum of the covariance matrix
between the players' strategies for the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ case.
Next, we calculate the average time-dependent community-wise
order parameter $\rho_m(t)$
for each community $m$ and find $\lambda$ and $\chi$
as the temporal- or community-wise- covariance of
$\rho_m(t)$, respectively.
\Cref{fig:chimera-index} shows these results
as functions of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
The left vertical axis depicts the chimera-like index $\chi$
in a solid line,
while the right vertical axis shows the metastability index
in a dashed line.
These simulations were run with
for \num{8E6} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
maximum joint benefit $B_0 = 0.15$,
and maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0 = \num{0.95} B_0$.

The metastability displayed in \cref{fig:chimera-index}
is quite low at $\le \num{0.01}$ compared
to a theoretical maximum of \num{0.08}.
This implies that the system is rather stable
and spends most of its time at a fairly constant
synchronicity $\rho_m(t)$.
Furthermore, while the metastability is higher (more unstable)
at $\approx \num{0.01}$ for the $\alpha = 0$ case,
the metastability drops precipitously for larger $\alpha$,
always staying below \num{0.004} implying that
higher asymmetry $\alpha$ makes the system more stable.
On the other hand, the chimera-like index $\chi$
attains fairly large values of \numrange{0.06}{0.13}
indicating a high chimeric quality.
Considering the theoretical maximum is \num{0.28},
the system is quite chimeric at nearly half the maximum.
Given that the chimera-like index is averaged over time,
this deviation from a complete chimera state
arise from both imperfect separation of the coherent/incoherent populations
as well as time fluctuations in the chimera quality.
While we observe that $\chi$ is a maximum at $\alpha = \num{0.75}$,
we caution that this is likely the result of calculating the communities
based off the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ covariances.
The fact that $\chi$ remains elevated for the other asymmetries $\alpha$
implies that this particular community decomposition
corresponds to an intrinsic separation rather than an artifact
of the particular $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ simulation.

%\subsection{Game-type dynamics}

  }
  \label{fig:phase-diagram}
\end{figure}

One of the key aspects of the EK model
is the variety of $2 \times 2$ game types available to the players.
\Cref{fig:game-type} showed that changing the asymmetry $\alpha$
affects the distribution of game types:
low asymmetry enhanced dilemma games,
symmetric $\alpha = 1/2$ games were primarily chicken games,
and higher asymmetries enhanced hero or deadlock games.
This can be understood by looking at the phase space of games
as a function of the three parameters $\beta$, $B$, and $\alpha$.
\Cref{fig:phase-diagram} shows two particular slices
of this three-dimensional phase space:
\cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_beta} shows a $B$-$\beta$ slice of phase space
and is an extension of figure 1 in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary},
while \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha} shows a $B$-$\alpha$ slice.

The homogeneity of game-types displayed for each $\alpha$ in \cref{fig:game-type}
is quite interesting and deserves additional discussion.
It appears the homogeneity arises  synchronicity,
as can be seen by comparing these results
to those well-mixed, $\alpha = 1/2$ case treated in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary};
note the name ``snowdrift'' was used in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to refer to the same game we (and \citet{bruns2015names}) call ``chicken''.
The $B_0/c = 1.5$ case depicted in figure 4 of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
shows the system spending the vast majority of its time in a synchronized state
with all players having the same $\phi$.
Since a completely synchronized system has $\Delta \phi = 0$ for all players,
$f(\Delta \phi) = 1$ and every interaction is characterized
by the rightmost white dot in \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_beta}),
which is located in the chicken region.
This is consistent with the $\alpha = 1/2$ column
of \cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} which shows nearly uniform chicken-type games.

Likewise, we note that the most frequent game types
in \cref{fig:game-type} across each $\alpha$ all correspond
to the completely synchronized $\Delta \phi = 0$ game type
(\ie the game type of the rightmost white dots \cref{fig:game-type}).
This indicates that the majority game type almost always
corresponds to games between nearly-synchronous individuals.
This is somewhat surprising for the $\alpha = 1$ case:
there, four of the $m = 20$ phase differences
(
$f(4\pi/20) B_0/c = f(16\pi/20) B_0/c = \num{0.98}$
and
$f(5\pi/20) B_0/c = f(15\pi/20) B_0/c = \num{0.75}$
)
fall in the pink battle-type region.
The warm colors (red, orange, and pink)
represent the game types (chicken, hero, and battle, respectively)
that have exponential fixation times~\citep{antal2006fixation},
so one might expect that these games would be over-represented
due to their long fixation times.
Nevertheless, the strong $\alpha = 1$ communicativeness bias
enhances synchronization and ensures that
chimeric qualities are suppressed
(\cf the low $\chi$ for $\alpha = 1$ in \cref{fig:chimera-index}).

Finally, while synchronicity can explain the game types
for the
\subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
the
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} game types
show a small ($\approx \SI{10}{\percent}$)
variance for the $\alpha = 0,1/4/,1/2$ games.
This is a feature of the average degree
of the different complete and non-complete graphs.
Since \cref{fig:game-type} depicts the most common game at each time step,
we need to consider the conditions under which a game type can be most common.
For the complete, well-mixed case, the game type corresponding
to the synchronized $\Delta \phi = 0$ state
is easily obtained---for instance, if the entire graph is synchronized,
or largely synchronized.
There are only two conditions when the $\Delta \phi = 0$ game type
is \emph{not} the most common game:
when there are many small groups with distinct phase $\phi$;
or when the game is almost evenly split between two groups
with fraction within $\pm 1/(2 \sqrt{N})$ of $1/2$.
For the $N = 20$ well-mixed case, this corresponds
each group containing between \numrange{8}{12} players,
but the magenta order parameter in \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed}
shows the well-mixed system spends must of its time with very few invaders---fewer
than the \numrange{8}{12} required to flip the most-common game type.

However, the \gls{celegans} case displays some heterogeneity
in most-common game type~\cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}.
While the number of players $N = 300$ is much larger
than the complete, well-mixed case,
the average indegree $\overline{d}_{\text{in}}$
is smaller (\num{12.36} \vs \num{19}).
Therefore, if we consider the non-complete, \gls{celegans} connectome graph
with two major populations
and assume they are randomly distributed (for ease of computation),
then the same calculations as above show that
the synchronized game type will \emph{not} be the most-common game
if the fraction of invaders is within $\pm 1/(2 \sqrt{d_{in}} + 1)$
of $1/2$, or \numrange{0.37}{0.63}.
We notice that the order parameter in \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}
actually spends a good deal of time in this range,
allowing for game types that don't correspond to the synchronized state.
While the $\alpha = 3/4$ case depicted \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}
still mostly displays hero-type games
(likely owing the particular geometry of $\alpha = 3/4$
with the hero region containing most of the white $\Delta \phi$ dots
in \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha}),
the $\alpha = 0, 1/4, 1/2$ cases all have wider $\Delta \phi$ regimes where
deadlock-type games can appear, as illustrated in \cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}.
Furthermore, the decreased in-degree of the \gls{celegans} could allow
for additional enhancement of the non-synchronized game types.
For instance, if regions of the connectome have a structure with more edges
\emph{between} player populations than \emph{amongst} them
(similar to a bipartite graph),
this would preferentially enhance non-synchronized game type edges.
More research needs to be done to investigate the role of this particular effect.

%\subsection{Chimera states}
The time step in \cref{fig:graph} was chosen
to demonstrate a chimera state:
there is a large, synchronized cluster
of non-communicative nodes with the same phase in red;
however, there is also a mixture of desynchronized nodes
with a collection of phases and communicativeness strategies
surrounding the synchronized cluster.
This splitting into synchronized and desynchronized groups
is characteristic of chimera states,
and corresponds to the high-chimera parameter ($\alpha = 0.75$)
in \cref{fig:chimera-index}.
Furthermore, while the homogeneity of the synchronized state is apparent
in \cref{fig:graph},
the coordinated time-variations of the synchronized group
provide additional evidence for the chimeric nature
of this parameter regime (see supplementary materials).

Previous studies \citep[\eg][]{bansal2019cognitive,santos2017chimera}
have noted the significance of chimera states in cognitive systems.
Therefore, the strength of the chimera state
(with a notably high chimera-like index of \num{0.15}) is particularly striking.
Given that this model only includes connectivity structure
as opposed to any biochemical aspects of neurons,
this suggests that chimeric cognitive states are strongly influenced
by connectivity patterns.
Further research is needed to see if this connection between chimeric quality
and connectivity structure extends to other model organisms.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we extended the evolutionary Kuramoto model
introduced by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to include structured interaction and reproduction graphs
as well as an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We first applied this model to a well-mixed population
and found that increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry
inhibits (promotes) communicativity.
Next, we applied the model to
a family of graphs deriving from the \gls{celegans} connectome,
including: the full directed, weighted graph;
an unweighted, directed graph;
and an undirected, weighted graph.
This revealed that the graph's directedness
had a minor effect of steepening the transition
from non-communicative to communicative
as the maximum joint benefit was increased.
However, the weightedness of the graph had a much more drastic effect
on the population by strongly suppressing the maximum communicativity.
For the weighted connectome graphs (both directed and undirected),
the communicative frequency asymptote decreased from unity
to approximately \num{0.7} for large $B_0$.
Finally, we found qualitative differences between the composition
of the well-mixed populations and the \gls{celegans} populations.
While the well-mixed players had largely homogeneous populations
that occasionally switched between fully communicative
and fully non communicative,
the \gls{celegans} population remained far more heterogenous
with a stable, chimeric mix of both communicators and non-communicators.
This chimera state in a model of the \gls{celegans} brain connectome
was suggestive of prior studies finding chimera states in human brains.
Potential avenues of future research include applying the model
to larger connectomes such as that
of \gls{dmelanogaster}~\citep{schlegel2024whole}.
Additionally, it could prove fruitful to analytically study
the dynamics of game types as a function of the payoff asymmetry
to better understand any long-run attractor game types.
