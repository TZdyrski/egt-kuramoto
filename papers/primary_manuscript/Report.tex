  % Basic introduction
  Chimera states of networked oscillators

  synchronized and disordered populations,
  are present
  in brains~\citep{santos2017chimera,bansal2019cognitive},
  and may be pivotal in human cognition~\citep{bansal2019cognitive}.
  % Detailed background
  Prior studies~\citep{deng2024chimera} investigated
  chimera-like brain states \gls{dmelanogaster}
  using sinusoidally-coupled Kuramoto oscillators,
  a frequent model for neuron dynamics~\citep{cabral2011role}.
  % General problem
  However, the small-scale evolutionary factors

  % Key takeaway
  In this work,
  we use evolutionary graph theory
  to connect single-neuron payoffs
  with network-wide chimera-like states
  on the \gls{celegans} connectome graph.
  % Main results
  We extend an evolutionary Kuramoto model for complete graphs
  to the weighted, directed \gls{celegans} network.
  This network shows stronger disorder
  than well-mixed populations do.
  Additionally, we find the network has
  low metastability ($\lambda < \num{0.01}$)
  but a large chimera-like index ($\xi \approx \num{0.13}$).
  % General context
  Our results connect individual neuron fitness
  and non-trivial brain topology
  to chimera-like brain states.
  % Broader perspective
  Our model represents a simple tool to probe

\section{Introduction}
%\subsection{Impact of structure on game evolution}
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is the application
of game theory to evolving populations
of players with fixed strategies.
This tool is useful for studying how local interaction rules
yield large-scale patterns such as cooperation~\citep{sigmund1999evolutionary}
and has found use in fields including international politics, ecology,
and protein folding~\citep{traulsen2023future}.
Studies~\citep{cohen2009evolutionary,antonioni2017coevolution,tripp2022evolutionary}
have even applied EGT to non-reproducing neurons by treating the learning
of interneuron communication strategies as an evolutionary process.
Evolutionary \emph{graph} theory places evolutionary game theory
on graphs to investigate the role of structure on population evolution.
Prior studies have found that structure
qualitatively changes game evolution.
For instance, cooperation is enhanced by
small-degree nodes~\citep{ohtsuki2006simple}
or unidirectional edges~\citep{su2022evolution}
and suppressed by weighted edges~\citep{bhaumik2024constant}.
Thus, any analysis of evolving, structured populations
must include the effects of
incompleteness, directedness, and weightedness.

%\subsection{Evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics}
Kuramoto networks are groups of coupled oscillators
where the coupling strength depends sinusoidally
on the oscillators' phase difference.
These networks are popular
models for neuron behaviour~\citep{cabral2011role,deng2024chimera}
because they exhibit tunable synchronization.
Prior studies~\citep{antonioni2017coevolution}
have modelled interneuron communication
with Kuramoto oscillators and EGT
using the prisoner's dilemma game type.
Other studies~\citep{tripp2022evolutionary}
generalized this approach to include dynamically changing game types
by introducing an evolutionary Kuramoto (EK) model
to show how the relationship between communication benefit and cost
influences the emergence of synchronized communication
or non-communication regimes.

%\subsection{Chimera states}
One intriguing aspect of neuron oscillations
is the observation of chimera states~\citep{majhi2019chimera}.
These states exhibit the simultaneous existence
of coherent and disordered phases~\citep{abrams2004chimera}.
Previous studies have proposed
chimera states as
a key component of human cognitive organization~\citep{bansal2019cognitive},
a facilitator of spiking and bursting phases~\citep{santos2017chimera},
and an outcome of modular networks~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Despite the observed importance of these chimera states,
the factors that give rise to coherent/disordered coexistence
remain incompletely characterized.

%\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome}
The nematode \gls{celegans}
is a model organism in neuroscience due to
its simple brain connectome~\citep{cook2019whole}
of only \num{302} neurons.
Despite their simplicity, models of the \gls{celegans} brain
still display a wide array of complex phenomena including
topologically-central rich clubs
crucial to motor neurons~\citep{towlson2013rich},
phenomenological connections to control theory~\citep{yan2017network},
and chimera states~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Therefore, this work will investigate the applicability
of evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics and chimera states
to the \gls{celegans} connectome model.

%\subsection{Outline}
In this paper, we will generalize
the evolutionary Kuramoto model
by adding an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs
and applying it to incomplete, directed, and weighted graphs.
These generalizations will allow us to apply the EK model
to the \gls{celegans} connectome
and analyze its communicativeness properties.
The model's simulation statistics
will allow us to connect
the individual neurons' payoffs
to the large-scale communicativeness properties
while also investigating the influence
of the \gls{celegans} connectome shape on chimera-like states.
Our EK model's simplicity and versatility make it a valuable tool
for investigating brain dynamics such as chimera states.

    their relative phase difference $\Delta \phi$.
  }\label{fig:connectivity}
\end{figure*}

We extend the EK model in two ways:
placing the player network on a directed, weighted graph;
and introducing a payoff asymmetry.
First, we represent a well-mixed population
as a complete graph in \cref{fig:graph_well-mixed}
with players represented by nodes and games by edges.
We generalize this to directed graphs
where game (edge) payoffs only flow to the head players (nodes).
We can also represent bidirectional games with
a pair of edges in both directions,
as shown in \cref{fig:player_interactions}.
For reference, the \gls{celegans} connectome
has \num{38} self-loops, \num{669} bidirectional edge pairs,
and \num{2331} unpaired edges.
Finally, we interpret the \gls{celegans} integer-valued
edge weights as the number of connections between nodes,
so these weights scale each payoff.

We also generalize the payoff structure to incorporate
an asymmetry between communicators and non-communicators.
We characterized each player (node) by its
strategy $s_i$---either communicative $C$ or non-communicative $N$---
and its phase $\phi_i$---taking one of \num{20} evenly-spaced values
between $0$ and $2 \pi$.
Communicative players always pay a cost $c$.
A game's benefit depends on whether the number of communicators is
zero (\num{0} benefit), one ($\beta_0$ mixed benefit),
or two ($B_0 > \beta_0$ joint benefit).
We incorporate the relative phase difference $\Delta \phi$
by modulating these benefits with a sinusoidal Kuramoto coupling
$f(\Delta \phi) = [1+\cos(\phi_j - \phi_i)]/2$.
Our new contribution is an asymmetry $\alpha \in [0,1]$
that biases the mixed benefit $\beta_0$ when exactly one of the players is communicative.
We multiply the $C$ player's mixed benefit by $\alpha/2$
and the $N$ player's benefit by $(1 - \alpha)/2$.
Using $\alpha = 0.5$ reproduces the symmetric case,
and increasing (decreasing) $\alpha$ allows us
to promote (suppress) communicativeness.
The payoff matrix in \cref{fig:payoff_matrix} summarizes these payoffs.

    $B$-$\beta$ plane
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha}}
    $B$-$\alpha$ plane.
    For two players with phase difference $\Delta \phi$,
    $B = B_0 [1 + \cos(\Delta \phi)]/2$
    and
    $\beta = \beta_0 [1 + \cos(\Delta \phi)]/2$.
    The legend displays the game type corresponding to each color.
    The white dots represent the $m=20$ potential phase differences.
    The cost $c$ is \num{0.1};
    for
    \protect{\subref{fig:phase-diagram-B_beta}}
    $\alpha = 0.5$,
    and for
    \protect{\subref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha}}
    $\beta_0 = \num{0.95} B_0$.
  }\label{fig:phase-diagram}
\end{figure*}

One of the key aspects of the EK model
is that multiple $2 \times 2$ game types
are available to the players during the population's evolution.
These game types~\citep{bruns2015names} include
dilemma (\aka{} ``prisoner's dilemma''),
deadlock (dilemma with the middle two payoffs swapped,
\aka{} ``anti-prisoner's dilemma''),
chicken (\aka{} ``hawk-dove'' or ``snowdrift''),
compromise (deadlock with the lowest two payoffs swapped,
\aka{} ``anti-chicken''),
battle (\aka{} ``leader'' or ``Bach or Stavinsky''),
hero (battle with the lowest two payoffs swapped),
or
harmony (game with strong incentive alignment).
We can visualize these games by looking at two-dimensional slices
of the three-dimension phase space
characterized by $\alpha$, $\beta \coloneqq \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi)$,
and $B \coloneqq B_0 f(\Delta \phi)$.
\cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_beta} shows a $B$-$\beta$ slice of phase space
and generalizes figure 1 of a prior study~\citep{tripp2022evolutionary},
while \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha} shows a $B$-$\alpha$ slice.
Each straight line of white dots represent permissible values of the $M = 20$ phases
$\Delta \phi_i$ across our simulations
and highlight which regions of parameter space are accessible.

    the left vertical axis of each subplot gives

    black if all players are non-communicative (``all-N'');

    The right vertical axis corresponds to the order parameter $\rho$
    (\pcref{eq:order_parameter}), in magenta, as a function of time.
    The asymmetry is
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0}}
    $\alpha = 0$,
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-075}}
    $\alpha = 0.75$,
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}}
    $\alpha = 1$,
    maximum joint benefit is $B_0 = 0.15$,
    and the simulations ran for \num{8E5} time steps.
    For all four
    \protect{\subref{fig:multi-comm-frac}}--\protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}}
    subplots,
    the network topologies are the
    $N=20$ well-mixed population,
    the maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$ at each step,
    the selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    and
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1}.
  }\label{fig:well-mixed}
\end{figure*}

First, we will explore the influence of the newly introduced asymmetry
on a $N=20$-player, well-mixed population.
\Cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} compares the frequency of communicative strategies
$f_{\text{comm}}$ to the maximum joint benefit $B_0$.
The marks represent the simulation results
and the lines represent the full analytic
result (\pcref{eq:full_analytic}) for a well-mixed population.
In general, $f_{\text{comm}}$ is low for small $B_0$,
rises to $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ at some break-even $B_0$,
and plateaus to $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 1$ for large $B_0$.
We can validate our model by comparing our
$\alpha = 0.5$ case with a previous study~\citep{tripp2022evolutionary}
to observe qualitatively similar results,
with our break-even $B_0 \approx 0.21$
corresponding to their $B_0 = 2 (N-1) c/(N-2) = 0.21$ break-even condition.
We also see that increasing (decreasing)
the asymmetry $\alpha$ dilates (stretches) this sigmoid function
in the $B_0$ direction.
This $\alpha$-dependence is reasonable,
as increasing $\alpha$ corresponds to biasing the payoff
in a mixed $C$-$N$ interaction towards the communicative partner.

While \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} displays
the time-averaged system state,
it is also useful to investigate the time-dependent variations.
\Crefrange{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0}{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}
depict the frequency
of communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$
as scatter plots of time on the left vertical axis
for different values of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
These time-series points are color-coded
grey if all players are communicative or
black if all players are non-communicative;
otherwise, the points are colored according
to the plurality game type, as indicated in the legend.
On the right vertical axes,
magenta line plots depict the order parameter
$\rho \in [0,1]$
given by \cref{eq:order_parameter}.
These plots shows the results
for a well-mixed population of $N=20$ players,
and the simulations ran
for \num{8E5} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
asymmetry $\alpha = 0.75$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
maximum joint benefit $B_0 = 0.15$,
and maximum mixed benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$.

\Cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0} shows the time-variation
when the system heavily favors non-communicative players
with $\alpha = 0$.
After an initial disordered, deadlock-type game (light blue),
the system synchronizes in the non-communicative regime
(black line at $f_{\text{comm}} = 0$).
\Cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-075} depicts an asymmetry $\alpha = 0.75$
that moderately encourages communicativeness.
The system is synchronized in a communicative state
(gray line at $f_{\text{comm}} = 1$) \SI{92}{\percent} of the time,
with unstable excursions to synchronized, non-communicative states
(black line at $f_{\text{comm}} = 0$)
and disordered, hero-type game states
(orange line with $0 < f_{\text{comm}} < 1$).
This \SI{92}{\percent} communicative rate is higher than the expected \SI{75}{\percent}
from \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} (for $B_0 = 0.15$ and $\alpha = 0.75$),
likely due to the small timespan shown in
\cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-075}.
Finally, \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1} shows the
$\alpha = 1$ case where communication is heavily incentivized.
In contrast to the \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0} $\alpha = 0$ case,
the system is virtually always synchronized in the communicative regime,
with only brief excursions to deadlock (light blue)
or harmony (light orange) type games.
We note that all three
\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0}-\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}
scenarios are virtually always synchronized;
the order parameter $\rho$ (magenta) is almost always $\rho = 1$,
with only occasional dips.
The temporary drops in communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$
and order parameter $\rho$ are likely the result of mutations
which occur, on average, every $1/\mu = \num{1E4}$ time steps.

\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} graphs}\label{sec:elegans_graph}

Here, we consider the weighted, directed hermaphroditic \gls{celegans} connectome.
For reference, \cref{fig:graph} shows the $N = 300$ nodes and the directed edges
(we exclude the two unconnected neurons CANL/CANR).
The nodes are colored according to their strategy at a particular time step,
with blues representing communicative strategies
and reds representing non-communicative ones,
with different shades corresponding to different phases $\phi$.
We note the chimera-like character
of the large, synchronized group of red nodes
coexisting with disordered neighboring nodes.

Next, to quantify the observations of \cref{fig:graph},
\cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} shows the fraction of players
using communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaged across
the entire simulation of \num{2E8} time steps as a function
of the maximum joint benefit $B_0$
for the \gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.
All subplots use a selection strength of $\delta=0.2$
and an asymmetry of $\alpha=0.75$.

We note that the behaviour
of the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
is qualitatively distinct
from the $\alpha = 0.75$ well-mixed case in \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac}.
The communicative fraction $f_{\text{comm}}$
is flatter for $B_0 \le 0.08$,
has a steep jump to \num{0.77} at $B_0 = 1.6$,
and decreases to a horizontal asymptote around \num{0.60}.
We can isolate the cause of this deviation
from the \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} well-mixed
behavior by looking at variations to the \cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} network topology.
First, the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted}
\emph{directed}, unweighted connectome
is qualitatively similar to the
\subref{fig:multi-comm-frac}
well-mixed case with a monotonic increase
from low communicativeness for $B_0 < 0.1$
to full communicativeness for $B_0 \ge 0.2$.
This implies that directedness
plays only a small role in the qualitative shape
of the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} full \gls{celegans} case.
Conversely,
the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
\emph{weighted}, undirected connectome
looks similar to the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
full \gls{celegans} case,
displaying the same plateau at $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 0.7$,
though the peak around $B_0 = 0.15$ is less pronounced.
This similarity implies that the connectome's edge weights
cause most of the deviation
between the \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} full \gls{celegans}
case and the \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} well-mixed case.

We can also investigate the time-evolution of the \gls{celegans} system
using the same parameters as the
\crefrange{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0}{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}
well-mixed case but with the \gls{celegans} connectome graph.
Compared to the well-mixed case,
the \subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
depicts a far more heterogeneous population.
Here, the population never stabilizes
to a fully communicative or non-communicative state.
Instead, both its communicative frequency and order parameter
stay between \SIrange{40}{70}{\percent}.
The mean communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}} \approx \SI{60}{\percent}$
is similar to the expected $f_{\text{comm}} \approx \SI{70}{\percent}$
from \cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} with $B_0 = 0.15$;
the discrepancy comes from the stochasticity
in this small, \num{8E5} time-step sample.
Finally, the \gls{celegans} case is less stable to mutations
than the \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-075} well-mixed case:
instead of stable synchronized states with transient impulses,
the \gls{celegans} case depicts disordered states with discontinuous offsets.

\end{figure*}

Time-lapse animations of the system's time evolution
(see supplementary materials)
show a subset of the nodes exhibiting high synchronicity
with others remaining disordered: this is characteristic of a chimera state.
In order to quantify this chimera-like effect, we will investigate
the chimera-like index $\chi$ (\pcref{eq:chimera_index})
and metastability index $\lambda$ (\pcref{eq:metastability_index}).
As discussed in \cref{sec:chimera-metastability-def},
the chimera-like index
measures the coherence difference between communities of players,
is equal to the time-averaged community covariance,
and has a theoretical maximum value
of \num{0.29}~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
Conversely, the metastability index
represents how often the system transitions
between synchronicity and disorder,
is equal to the community-average of the temporal covariance,
and has a practical maximum of \num{0.08}~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
\Cref{fig:chimera-index} shows the
\subref{fig:chimera_index} chimera-like index $\chi$
and
\subref{fig:metastability_index} metastability index $\lambda$
as functions of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
These simulations ran with the same parameters as the
\crefrange{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
\gls{celegans} time-series data.

The metastability displayed in \cref{fig:chimera-index}
is less than \num{0.01}, much smaller
than the theoretical maximum of \num{0.08}.
This implies that the system is metastable
and spends most of its time at a nearly constant
synchronicity $\rho_m(t)$.
Furthermore, while the metastability is higher (more unstable)
at $\approx \num{0.01}$ for the $\alpha = 0$ case,
the metastability drops precipitously for larger $\alpha$,
always staying below \num{0.004} implying that
higher asymmetry $\alpha$ makes the system more stable.
Conversely, the chimera-like index $\chi$
indicates a high chimeric quality
with values (\numrange{0.06}{0.13})
nearly half of the theoretical maximum (\num{0.28}).
Given that we average the chimera-like index over time,
the system's deviation from a complete chimera state
arises from both imperfect separation of the coherent/disordered populations
as well as time fluctuations in the chimeric quality.
While we observe that $\chi$ has a maximum at $\alpha = \num{0.75}$,
we caution that this is likely the result of calculating the communities
based on the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ covariances.
Nevertheless, the high $\chi$ value for all asymmetries $\alpha$
implies that the strong chimeric character is intrinsic
rather than an artifact of our $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ choice.

\subsection{Game types}

    and the simulations ran for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }\label{fig:game-type}
\end{figure*}

Next, we seek to understand the types of games
that nodes play during the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:game-type}, we investigate the plurality game type
amongst all player interactions at each time step~(\cf{} \cref{sec:plurality_game_type})
\Cref{fig:game-type} shows the fraction of time
a given game type is the plurality for different values
of the asymmetry $\alpha$ for
\subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
$N=20$ well-mixed,
and
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome
network topologies.
The \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that system is fully synchronized
for over \SI{99.3}{\percent} of the runtime
across every asymmetry $\alpha$.
In contrast, the
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} connectome system
is never synchronized.
Instead, disordered game types (\ie{} states other than ``all-C'' or ``all-N'')
dominate,
with the dominant game type changing as the asymmetry varies:
dilemma for $\alpha = 0, 0.25$, chicken for $\alpha = 0.5$,
hero for $\alpha = 0.75$, and deadlock for $\alpha = 1$.
Additionally, the \gls{celegans} system displays
some game-type heterogeneity, with
a second game type (deadlock) being the plurality
\SIrange{1}{14}{\percent} of the time
for asymmetries $\alpha \le 0.5$.
Overall, we see that graph structure decreases synchronization
and asymmetry influences the dominant game types.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

%\subsection{Game-type dynamics}
The distribution of game types displayed in \cref{fig:game-type}
deserves additional discussion.
The \cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case
is virtually always synchronized,
as corroborated by the order parameter $\rho \approx 1$ in
\crefrange{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-0}{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-1}.
Furthermore,
the $\alpha$-dependence of the
communicative synchronization (``all-C'') fraction
approximates the communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$
in \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} for $B_0=0.15$.
For the $< \SI{1}{\percent}$ of the time when the well-mixed system is
\emph{not} synchronized, the other game types are
dilemma (\SI{0.2}{\percent} for $\alpha = 0, 0.25$)
chicken (\SI{0.3}{\percent} for $\alpha = 0.5$),
hero (\SI{0.3}{\percent} for $\alpha = 0.75$),
and
deadlock (\SI{0.3}{\percent} for $\alpha = 1$).
We note that these disordered game types
are the same as the most-frequent plurality games,
for each $\alpha$, as those played in
the \cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} setup.

We can compare the \cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
$\alpha = 0.5$ case
to the time-series results
in previous studies~\citep{tripp2022evolutionary}.
Those results also show the system spending
virtually all of its time in a synchronized state.
When not synchronized, their system had plurality
chicken (denoted ``snowdrift'' therein)
and staghunt (denoted ``coordination'',
not to be confused with the coordination-type game
in our \cref{fig:phase-diagram}) games.
The presence of staghunt-type games is surprising,
as \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_beta}
shows that the staghunt region should be inaccessible
for the given parameter values (white dots).
However, the chicken-type game is consistent with our
\SI{0.3}{\percent} chicken games for $\alpha = 0.5$.

Next, we consider the distribution of disordered games
in \cref{fig:game-type} as functions of $\alpha$.
Recall that the most-frequent disordered games
in \cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
and \cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} are identical,
so this discussion applies to both setups.
In the \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha}
$B-\alpha$ parameter plane,
each of the five $\alpha$ values
correspond to a horizontal line of white dots.
Additionally, the warm colors (red, orange, and pink)
represent game types (chicken, hero, and battle, respectively)
with exponentially slow fixation times~\citep{antal2006fixation}.
So we might expect any constant-$\alpha$ line (white dots) intersecting
a warm-colored region
to be dominated by the corresponding game in \cref{fig:game-type}.
This is the case with $\alpha = 0.5, 0.75$,
but not for $\alpha = 1$,
which mainly shows deadlock type games.
Instead, we note that every $\alpha$ case \emph{is} dominated
by the game-type of the rightmost white dots
representing nearly-synchronized $\Delta \phi \approx 0$ configurations.

We can explain the prevalence of nearly-synchronous game types
by considering game-plurality requirements.
We easily obtain nearly-synchronized $\Delta \phi \approx 0$
game-type pluralities whenever the graph is largely synchronized.
Finding circumstances when $\Delta \phi \approx 0$ game types
are \emph{not} the plurality is more challenging,
but we identify two such scenarios in \cref{sec:multiple_equal_groups}:
configurations with $p$ equal-sized groups
with phases that differ by $2 \pi/p$ (\cf{} \cref{sec:multiple_equal_groups});
or when the population is almost evenly split between two groups
with fractions between $0.5 \pm 1/(2 \sqrt{N})$
(\cf{} \cref{sec:two_unequal_groups}).
Given the low mutation rate, it is unlikely to have
multiple populations with roughly equal sizes,
so the evenly-split scenario is more likely.
For the $N = 20$ well-mixed case, this corresponds
to \SIrange{39}{62}{\percent}, or \numrange{8}{12} players.
But the magenta order parameter in \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed_alpha-075}
shows that the well-mixed system spends must of its time
with fewer than the required \num{8} invaders.
This explains why the well-mixed graph's disordered games
are still nearly-synchronized.

These graph-degree conditions also help explain the
game distributions for the
\cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} graph.
Each $\alpha$-value is still dominated by the nearly-synchronized
game types, as these are still the most likely.
Nevertheless, the $\alpha = 0$, $0.25$, and $0.5$ cases
show significant levels of non-synchronized game types
(\SI{13}{\percent}, \SI{3}{\percent}, and \SI{1}{\percent} deadlock games,
respectively).
While the $0.5 \pm 1/(2 \sqrt{N})$ condition above seems to imply it
should be \emph{harder} for the \gls{celegans} graph to show
non-synchronized deadlock games since
the number of players $N=300$ is larger,
we note that the \gls{celegans} average degree $\overline{d}$
is \emph{smaller} (\num{12.36} \vs{} \num{19}).
Indeed, repeating the derivation for (random regular) incomplete graphs
(\cf{} \cref{sec:two_unequal_groups_incomplete})
shows that we must replace $N$ with $N \overline{d}/(N-1)$,
widening the range to \SIrange{36}{64}{\percent}.
The order parameter in \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}
is usually in this range,
allowing for non-synchronized game types like deadlock.

%\subsection{Chimera states}
Next, we will discuss the observed chimera states.
While the chimera-like quality is inherently time-dependent
(\cf{} \pcref{eq:chimera_index})
carefully chosen snapshots can still convey some of the chimera-like aspects.
\Cref{fig:graph_celegans_asymmetry0} shows a snapshot of the communication strategies
for asymmetry $\alpha = 0$ using the same color scheme as \cref{fig:graph}.
We notice a large region of light red representing
a synchronized group of non-communicators,
as well as a mix of disordered neighbors.
This coexistence of strong synchronization and disorder
is consistent with the high
chimera-like index $\chi$ observed in \cref{fig:chimera-index} for $\alpha = 0$.
Likewise, the $\alpha = 0.75$ case depicted in \cref{fig:graph}
has an even higher $\chi = \num{0.13}$,
consistent with the coexistence of a large,
synchronized non-communicative group (red)
and disordered neighbors (varying phases/colors).
In contrast,
\cref{fig:graph_celegans_asymmetry1} shows a snapshot for $\alpha = 1$,
for which we expect a lower chimera-like index of $\chi = \num{0.06}$.
Indeed, we see that the large communicative (red) group
in \cref{fig:graph_celegans_asymmetry1}
or \cref{fig:graph} has fractured into two different
communicative (blue) groups, lowering the chimeric quality.
Therefore, these snapshots give a glimpse of the chimera-like quality
in the \gls{celegans} populations.

Another study of the \gls{celegans} connectome also found
chimera-like states using an entirely non-game-theory tool,
modular neural networks~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
That study found a maximum chimera-like index of \num{0.12},
similar to our value of \num{0.13}.
The agreement between these different models
of the \gls{celegans} connectome
support the claim that the connectivity structure---rather than
a particular neuron model or any biochemical qualities---is responsible
for the chimera states.

%\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we extended the evolutionary Kuramoto model
to include weighted, structured interaction graphs
and an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We first applied this model to a well-mixed population
and found that increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry
inhibits (promotes) communicativity.
Next, we applied the model to
a family of graphs deriving from the \gls{celegans} connectome.
This revealed that the graph's weightedness
has a much stronger influence on the communication frequency
than the graph's directedness does.
Finally, while the well-mixed players have homogeneous populations
that occasionally switch between synchronized communicative
and  non-communicative states,
the \gls{celegans} population remains far more heterogenous
with a stable, chimeric mix of disordered game types.

A future goal of this work is to apply the EK model
to entire families of random regular graphs.
The limited number of graphs analyzed in this study
prevent the identification of exact relationships
between the communicative fraction and graph properties
such as edge degree, weight, and directionality;
applying the model to parameterized families of graphs could allow
for fine-tuning the parameters to extract these relations.
Furthermore, the parameter-space analysis provided clues
regarding the types of games the neurons played,
but additional study is necessary to determine a causal relation.
Studying the parameter space attractors
could provide this connection
by revealing the long-time game distributions
and yielding important implications for the neurons' fitness landscape.
Finally, since this study only considers a single species' connectome,
it is unclear if our findings regarding the dependence
of chimeric activity on graph structure are generalizable.
We plan to investigate this connection further
by applying our EK setup to other model organisms,
such as that of
\glsxtrlong{dmelanogaster}~\citep{schlegel2024whole}.

A key takeaway from this study was the importance
of edge weight on communicativity;
this has important parallels to neural computing,
where edge weights are a primary driver of functionality.
Additionally, the observation of chimeric states
arising from such simple neuron models
implies that neuron structure is likely
a key component in producing these critical brain states.
Overall, evolutionary graph theory allowed us
to connect low-level payoff details for individual neurons
to high-level phenomena such as chimera-states,
and this model could serve as a valuable tool
for clarifying the influence of network structure on neural dynamics.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Game setup}\label{sec:game_setup}
We model the system of evolving, coupled oscillators
by discretizing the $2\pi$ phase angle into $m$ discrete phases $2 \pi j/m$
for $j \in 0, \ldots, m-1$.
The game's strategy space is the outer product of the $m$ phases
($m = 20$ for our simulations) and $2$ communicative choices,
communicative $C$ and non-communicative $N$.
For a given pair of phases, $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$, the game is specified
by the payoff matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-col,first-row,hvlines]
  & C, \phi_j & N, \phi_j \\
  C, \phi_i & B_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c & 2 \alpha \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c \\
  N, \phi_i & 2 (1 - \alpha) \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) & 0
\end{bNiceMatrix}
\label{eq:payoff-matrix}
\end{equation}
with $f(\Delta \phi) = [1+\cos(\phi_j - \phi_i)]/2$
(\pcref{fig:payoff_matrix}).
Here, $B_0$, $\beta_0$, $\alpha$, and $c$ are fixed parameters
defining the game.
The cost $c$ represents the penalty paid by communicative players,
and $B_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the maximum benefits paid with
joint $C$-$C$ communicators and mixed $C$-$N$ players, respectively.
The phase-dependent function $f(\Delta \phi)$ encodes
the influence of phase mismatches.
Finally, the benefit asymmetry $\alpha \in [0,1]$ breaks the symmetry
between the payoff for the communicator and the non-communicator
when exactly one player is communicative.

\subsection{Population setup}\label{sec:pop_setup}

Given $N$ players, we associate a pair
of weighted, directed graphs to the population.
First, we use an interaction graph with $N$ nodes representing players
and weighted, directed edges representing games between players.
Second, we implement a reproduction graph with the $N$ nodes
still representing players
but the edges now corresponding to the ability of nodes to replace one another.
For simplicity, our reproduction graphs are identical to the interaction graph
with a single self-loop added to each node.
These self-loops are necessary in the reproduction graph
to ensure that each node has positive indegree
as required by the Moran process described in the next section.

\subsection{Birth-death Moran process}\label{sec:evo_setup}
% TODO: Bd is hugely different from death-Birth dynamics (dB);
% this dB is more favorable for cooperation
% Try this instead?
The population is updated according to a birth-death Moran process
with exponential fitness~\citep{lieberman2005evolutionary}.
On each turn, the following steps are performed.
First, each edge in the interaction graph corresponds to a game
between head node $i$ and tail node $j$,
the edge's payoff $\pi_{ji}$ is scaled by the edge weight $w_{ji}$,
and the relevant payoff $w_{ji} \pi_{ji}$ is awarded to the head node only.
Since the \gls{celegans} edge weights are integers,
we can also interpret each edge weight as the number of games played
between the two nodes.
\Cref{fig:player_interactions} shows an illustration of this process
for a single pair of interacting players connected by a pair of
weighted, directed edges.
The total fitness for node $i$ is the exponential of the product
between the selection strength $\delta$
and the sum of payoffs to node $i$,
or $f_i = \exp(\delta \sum_j w_{ji} \pi_{ji})$ with the sum
over all edges inwardly incident to node $i$.
Then, a single focal node is chosen for reproduction
with probability proportional to the node's fitness $f_i$.
Finally, a node is chosen for replacement amongst the birth node's out-neighbors
with probability proportional to the reproduction graph's edge weight.
With mutation probability $\mu$,
the death node is replaced by a player with a uniformly random strategy;
otherwise, it is replaced by a player with the same strategy as the birth node.
This birth-death process is repeated for each turn.

\subsection{Communication frequency}
We define the frequency of communicative strategies
$f_{\text{comm}}(t)$ as the fraction of players employing
a communicative strategy $C$ at a given time step.
We also define the time-averaged communicative frequency
$f_{\text{comm}}$
by averaging $f_{\text{comm}}(t)$ over the entire simulation.
For simulation times long compared to the mutation turnover time
$T_{\text{turn}} \gg N/\mu$,
the initial, random distribution of strategies will be negligible
and the time-average will correspond to the long-time limit.
In the supplemental material,
we derive an analytic expression \cref{eq:full_analytic} for
$f_{\text{comm}}$ in the well-mixed case
by incorporating the benefit asymmetry $\alpha$.

\subsection{Game type nomenclature}
Every edge of the interaction graph
defines a game between the two players it connects.
Using their relative phase difference $\Delta \phi$,
we can calculate the payoff matrix.
By comparing the order of each of the four entries,
we determine the game type using
a topological taxonomy~\citep{bruns2015names}.
Using this taxonomy, we calculate the ordinal rank of the four entries
in the \cref{eq:payoff-matrix} payoff matrix
and assign a unique name (\eg{} dilemma, deadlock, chicken, \etc{})
to each strict, symmetric game type.
However, \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha}
shows that game type lies on the border between two game types
when $\alpha = 1$ or $B/c = 0$ (corresponding to $\Delta \phi = \pi$).
The taxonomy classifies these non-strict games
according the number and location of ties (``high tie'', ``middle tie'',
``double tie'', \etc{}).
It also defines a convention for choosing one of the neighboring game types
to get a binomial nomenclature (\eg{} ``high harmony'', ``mid compromise'',
``double coordination'', \etc{}).
We follow the same convention for choosing a neighboring game
but drop the tie-indicator to keep our figure legends simple.
Specifically, referring to \cref{fig:phase-diagram-B_alpha},
the $\alpha = 1$ tie between deadlock and compromise games
formally corresponds to ``low [dead]lock'',
but we label it as deadlock.
Likewise, all of the $B/c = 0$ payoff matrices
correspond to the ``double harmony'' game type,
but we denote them as simply ``harmony''.

\subsection{Plurality game type}\label{sec:plurality_game_type}
At each time step, we calculate the game type for each edge
of the interaction graph.
We then identify the plurality game type across all player interactions,
where each edge's count is weighted by its edge weight.
Then, we calculate the frequency of this ``plurality game'' across
all time steps of a given simulation to determine the distribution
of games commonly played.
Note that an edge's game type is independent
of the players' communicativeness and only depends on
their dynamically-evolving relative phase $\Delta \phi$
and the fixed game parameters $c$, $B_0$, $\beta_0$, and $\alpha$.
Furthermore, this metric is only sensitive to the
plurality game and therefore provides no information
on the presence/absence of minority game types.

\subsection{Order parameter}
Given that the Kuramoto system of coupled oscillators
inspired this evolutionary game model,
we also define the standard Kuramoto order parameter:
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{1}{N} \abs{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{\im \phi_j}}
  \label{eq:order_parameter}
\end{equation}
This parameter ranges from zero to one, inclusive,
and represents how coherent the population is,
with $\rho = 1$ for fully coherent and $\rho = 0$ fully disordered.

\subsection{Chimera-like index and metastability index}\label{sec:chimera-metastability-def}
To compare with a previous analysis~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera} of
chimera-like states \gls{celegans} models,
we define a pair of indices related to
chimera-like quality and metastability~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
First, we organize the game's nodes
into $M$ disjoint communities.
We split the nodes into $M=2$ communities $C_m$
by taking a subset
(the first \num{8E4} steps for computations ease)
of the simulation results
for the \gls{celegans} simulation with asymmetry $\alpha = \num{0.75}$.
We then calculate the covariance matrix $K_{i,j}$ of the strategy indices,
ensuring that communicative ($C$, $\phi_i$)
and non-communicative ($N$, $\phi_i$) are treated distinctly.
Next, we calculate the row-wise covariance-sums  $\sum_i K_{i,j}$.
After finding the node with the maximum covariance-sum
$\cov_{\text{max}} \coloneqq \max_j{\sum_i K_{i,j}}$,
we form a community by collecting all nodes $j$ with covariance-sum
at least \num{1500}, $\sum_i K_{i,j} \ge 1500$.
Note that \num{1500} is approximately \SI{81}{\percent}
of the maximum covariance-sum,
so this ensure we only group nodes with high covariance-sum.
Finally, we place all the remaining nodes in a second community.

With these disjoint communities $C_m$, we then calculate
the time-dependent, community-wise order parameter $\rho_m(t)$
as
\begin{equation}
  \rho_m(t) \coloneqq \frac{1}{N_m} \abs{\sum_{j \in C_m} e^{\im \phi_j}}
\end{equation}
across members $j$ of community $C_m$ with size $N_m$.
Then, we define a chimera-like index $\chi$
\begin{equation}
  \chi = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{chi}}}_T
  \label{eq:chimera_index}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma_{\text{chi}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{m=1}^M
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_M}^2
\end{equation*}
and a metastability index $\lambda$
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{met}}}_M
  \label{eq:metastability_index}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma_{\text{met}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_T}^2
\end{equation*}
across the $M$ communities and $T$ time steps.
The chimera-like index measures the difference in coherence between communities:
complete homogeneity between communities
(\eg{} all fully synchronized \emph{or} fully disordered)
corresponds to $\chi = 0$,
while having two equally-sized communities
with one fully synchronized and one fully disordered
for all times yields a maximum $\chi = 2/7 \approx
\num{0.29}$~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
Likewise, the metastability index $\lambda$ measures how metastable
the system is (\ie{} transiting between synchronicity and disorder).
A system that is fully synchronized or disordered gives $\lambda = 0$,
while spending equal times in each states yields $\lambda = 1/12
\approx \num{0.08}$~\citep{shanahan2010metastable}.
