\begin{itemize}
  \item Weighted (connectome) vs.\ unweighted (connectome w/o
    weights): weighting reduces synchronization
  \item Connectome is connected, weighted, directed cyclic graph
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Therefore, \emph{cannot} directly use
      \cite{allen2017evolutionary}, since it only applies to undirected
      graphs
  \end{itemize}
  \item Low selection strength ($0.005$) keeps mostly around synchronicity
    $\approx 1.0$, with a small break to 0.8 \emph{before} $B_{\text{crit}}$
  \item High selection strength ($0.2$) has low synchronicity
    ($\approx 0.0$) before $B_{\text{crit}}$ but increases (at roughly
    $B_{\text{crit}}$) to $\approx 0.5$
  \item Hence, it seems that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Neither low nor high selection strength corresponds to
      well-mixed case
    \item Low and high selection strengths do not appear to be simple
      stretching about $B_{\text{crit}}$ as in the well-mixed case
  \end{enumerate}
  \item We can calculate the average number of communicative at each
    time step and calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient of
    this number against each node's communicative state:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Results for c-elegans, $B_{\text{factor}} = 1.5$, $2E6$ timesteps,
      $\delta = 2$, $\mu = 0.2$
    \item We find that the maximum correlation is \num{0.41}, mean
      correlation is \num{0.03}, std correlation is \num{0.06}. That
      is, there are a few outliers with high correlation
    \item Unfortunately, these are \emph{not} the premotor neurons
      (all had correlation $\approx \num{0.1}$)
    \item Instead, the ones with correlation above \num{0.35} were
      indices 101, 117, 211, and 219 (IL1L, AUAL, SMBDL, and SIADL)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forcing strength dependence}
\begin{itemize}
  \item For strong forcing $\delta = 0.2$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Undirected and unweighted looks like a spread-out, symmetric
      version of well-mixed
    \item Adding weights suppresses communication, lowering ceiling
      for fraction of communication from \num{1} to \num{0.8}
    \item Adding directedness introduces strange staircase-like shape
      and slightly depresses ceiling from \num{1} to \num{0.9}
    \item Full weighted, directed version shows both staircase-like
      shape and strongly suppressed ceiling to \num{0.6}
  \end{itemize}
  \item For weak forcing $\delta = 0.005$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Undirected and unweighted has strange staircase-like shape
    \item Adding weights sharpens jump around $B_\text{crit}$, nearly
      matching well-mixed case
    \item Adding directedness strongly suppresses selection, with
      ceiling and floor compressed to the range $[0.3,0.6]$
    \item Full weighted, directed version shows strange, non-monotonic
      behavior. More investigation is needed
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
