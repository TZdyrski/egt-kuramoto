\abstract{
  We extend the evolutionary Kuramoto model of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
  by introducing an asymmetry between communicator and non-communicator payoffs
  as well as placing the players on structured interaction and reproduction graphs.
  We apply the model to the \glsfmtshort{celegans} brain connectome
  to investigate how well the evolutionary oscillators can model synchronicity of the brain.
  We then simulate the populations' evolution across a variety of parameter regimes.
  These results show that weighted interaction graphs,
  including the \glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome,
  serve to decrease the overall communicativeness of the population.
  Additionally, varying the payoff asymmetry changes the types
  of games the individual players play.
  Finally, we find chimeric states in the \glsfmtshort{celegans} case
  which suggests potential connections to previous findings
  of chimera populations in human brains.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Impact of structure on game evolution}
Evolutionary game theory is the application of evolutionary fitness dynamics
to population of players with fixed strategies playing repeated games.
This tool is particularly well-suited to studying how microscopic interaction rules
give rise to macroscopic population patterns such as cooperation
and has found use from international politics and ecology
to protein folding~\citep[\cf{}][and references therein]{traulsen2023future}.
Evolutionary \emph{graph} theory places evolutionary game theory
on graphs to investigate the role of structure on population evolution.
Numerous studies have found that introduction structure
can qualitatively change the population's evolution.
For instance, cooperation can be enhanced by
decreasing the average number of edges~\citep{ohtsuki2006simple},
or having an intermediate proportion
of unidirectional edges~\citep{su2022evolution},
while cooperation is suppressed
for weighted graphs~\citep{bhaumik2024constant}.
Thus, the complex influences of
incompleteness, directedness, and weightedness combine
to enrich the variety of outcomes for evolving populations.

\subsection{Evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics}
Evolutionary game theory (EGT) is a tool that extends traditional game theory
to support populations of non-rational players to understand
how populations approach equilibria~\citep{weibull1997evolutionary}.
EGT has proven particularly useful in the study
of cooperation~\citep[\eg{}][and sources therein]{sigmund1999evolutionary}.
Previously, \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} created an EGT model
to capture the behaviour of sinusoidally coupled (\ie{} Kuramoto) oscillators
using game-theoretic approaches.
This model allowed them to investigate how cooperation might arise
amongst collections of communicative and non-communicative neurons
in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Though permanent cells such as neurons don't reproduce,
the activation features (\ie{} strategies) can still
be studied with \emph{evolutionary} game theory
if learning is treated as
an evolutionary process~\citep{cohen2009evolutionary}.
This evolutionary Kuramoto model
supplemented the usual communicative/non-communicative
strategy pair with an independent dimension representing the player's ``phase''.
\Citet{tripp2022evolutionary} assumed a well-mixed model of players
on a complete graph, and the players' payoffs were modulated
by a sinusoidal-dependence on their relative phases,
representing the classic Kuramoto oscillator coupling.
This study showed the emergence of various communicative (C)
and non-communicative (N) regimes depending on the relative sizes
of the joint CC benefit $B_0$, the mixed CN/NC benefit $\beta_0$,
and the cost $c$ imposed on communicators.

\subsection{Chimera states}
One intriguing aspect of neurons oscillations
is the observation of chimera states~\citep
[\eg{}][and references therein]{majhi2019chimera}.
These states exhibit the simultaneous existence
of coherent and incoherent phases~\citep{abrams2004chimera}.
These chimera states have been proposed
as a key component of human cognitive organization~\citep{bansal2019cognitive},
a facilitator of spiking and bursting phases~\citep{santos2017chimera},
and an outcome of modular networks~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Despite the observed importance of these chimera states,
the facts that give rise to coherent/incoherent coexistence
remain incompletely characterized.

\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} connectome}
The nematode \gls{celegans}
is a model organism for neuronal studies due to
its relatively simple brain connectome~\citep{cook2019whole}.
With a connectome containing just \num{302} neurons,
the hermaphroditic \gls{celegans} is far more tractable to study
than the nearly \num{100e9} neurons
in the human brain~\citep[\eg][]{von2016search}.
Despite their simplicity, models of the \gls{celegans} brain
still display a wide array of complex phenomena including
topologically-central rich clubs
crucial to motor neurons~\citep{towlson2013rich},
phenomenological connections to control theory~\citep{yan2017network},
and chimeric states~\citep{hizanidis2016chimera}.
Therefore, this work will investigate the applicability
of evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics to the \gls{celegans}
connectome model.

\subsection{Outline}
In this paper,we will generalize
the Evolutionary Kuramoto (EK) model
of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} with an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We will also apply this model to incomplete, directed, and weighted graphs.
These generalization will allow us to apply the EK model
to the \gls{celegans} connectome
and analyze its communicativeness properties.
\Cref{sec:game_setup} will outline the setup of the game that neurons play.
In \cref{sec:pop_setup}, we describe the different types
of graphs we will analyze.
Then, we lay out the evolutionary rules for updating the population
in \cref{sec:evo_setup}.
We define the various statistics collected in \cref{sec:stats_setup}.
We will present the results of these simulations for
complete graphs (\cref{sec:complete_graph})
and the \gls{celegans} connectome (\cref{sec:elegans_graph}).
Finally, \cref{sec:discussion} will be used
for discussing the role of the EK generalizations
and its implications for \gls{celegans} brain structure.

\section{Methods and models}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Game setup}
\label{sec:game_setup}
Here, we use an extension of the Kuramoto game from \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
as a model for evolving, coupled oscillators.
We discretize the $2\pi$ phase angle into $m=20$ discrete phases $2 \pi j/m$
for $j \in 0 \ldots m-1$.
The game's strategy space is the outer product of the $m$ phases and $2$ communicative choices,
communicative $C$ and non-communicative $N$.
For a given pair of phases, $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$, the game is specified
by the payoff matrix
\begin{equation}
\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-col,first-row,hvlines]
  & C, \phi_j & N, \phi_j \\
  C, \phi_i & B_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c & 2 \alpha \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) - c \\
  N, \phi_i & 2 (1 - \alpha) \beta_0 f(\Delta \phi) & 0
\end{bNiceMatrix}
\label{eq:payoff-matrix}
\end{equation}
with $f(\Delta \phi) = [1+\cos(\phi_j - \phi_i)]/2$.
Here, $B_0$, $\beta_0$, $\alpha$, and $c$ are fixed parameters
defining the game.
The cost $c$ represents the penalty paid by communicative players,
and $B_0$ and $\beta_0$ are the in-phase benefits paid with exactly
two or one communicative player, respectively.
The phase-dependent function $f(\Delta \phi)$ encodes
the influence of phase mismatches.
Finally, the benefit asymmetry $\alpha \in [0,1]$ breaks the symmetry
between the payoff for the communicator and the non-communicator
when exactly one player is communicative.

\subsection{Population setup}
\label{sec:pop_setup}
In this study, we consider a collection of different population graphs
to highlight the role of structure on communicativeness.
Given $N$ players, associate a pair
of weighted, directed graphs to the population.
First, we use an interaction graph with $N$ nodes representing players
and edges representing games between players;
here, the direction shows which player receives the payoff
scaled by the edge-weight.
Second, we implement a reproduction graph with the $N$ nodes
still representing players
but the edges now corresponding to ability of nodes to replace one another;
specifically, the tail node may replace the head node,
and its fitness is scaled by the edge weight.
For simplicity, our reproduction graphs are identical to the interaction graph
with a single self-loop added to each node.
These self-loops are necessary in the reproduction graph
to ensure that each node has positive indegree
as required by the Moran process described in the next section.

\subsection{Birth-death Moran process}
\label{sec:evo_setup}
The population is updated according to a birth-death Moran process
with exponential fitness.
On each turn, the following steps are performed.
First a game is played for each edge $j$ in the interaction graph,
each edge's payoff $\pi_j$ is scaled by the edge weight $w_j$,
and the relevant payoff $w_j \pi_j$ is awarded to the head node only.
The total fitness for node $i$ is the exponential of the product
between the selection strength $\delta$
and the sum of payoffs to node $i$,
or $f_i = \exp(\delta \sum_j w_j \pi_j)$ with the sum
over all edges inwardly incident to node $i$.
Then, a single focal node is chosen for reproduction
with probability proportional to the node's fitness $f_i$.
Finally, a node is chosen for replacement amongst the birth node's outneighbors
with probability proportional to the reproduction graph's edge weight.
With mutation probability $\mu$,
the death node is replaced by a player with a uniformly random strategy;
otherwise, it is replaced by a player with the same strategy as the birth node.
This birth-death process is repeated for each turn.

\subsection{Statistics collected}
\label{sec:stats_setup}
A variety of statistics will be used to quantify the evolution
of the games' populations.
First, we determine the frequency of communicative strategies
$f_{\text{comm}}$ as the fraction of players employing
a communicative strategy $C$ at a given time.
We are also interested in defining the time-averaged communicative frequency
by averaging $f_{\text{comm}}$ over the entire simulation;
for simulation times long compared to the mutation turnover time $T \gg N/\mu$,
the initial, random distribution of strategies will be negligible
and the time-average will correspond to the long-time limit.

We are interested in comparing the $f_{\text{comm}}$ simulation results
to an analytic model.
In the appendix, we analytically extend the work of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to account for benefit asymmetry $\alpha$.
The resulting communicative fraction \cref{eq:full_analytic}
is derived for the well-mixed case.
To apply \cref{eq:full_analytic} to non-complete graphs such as
the \gls{celegans} connectome,
we replace the indegree $N-1$ with the average indegree of the graph
$N-1 \to \overline{d}_{\text{in}}$.
For reference, this is \num{19} for the well-mixed case with $N=20$ players
and \num{13.36} for the \gls{celegans} case.

During the game's evolution,
each pair of connected players will be playing a variety of game types
such as deadlock, dilemma, chicken, \etc{}
\citep[\cf{}][for definitions]{bruns2015names}.
We will analyze the types of games being played by
identifying the most common game type across all player interactions,
weighted by the interaction graph edge weights,
at each time step.
Then, we calculate the frequency of this ``most common game'' across
all time steps of a given simulation to determine the distribution
of games commonly played.
Note that this metric is only sensitive to the
plurality game and therefore provides no information
on the presence/absence of infrequent game types.

Given that this evolutionary game model was inspired
by the Kuramoto system of coupled oscillators,
we will also use the standard Kuramoto order parameter:
\begin{equation}
  \rho = \frac{1}{N} \abs{\sum_{j=1}^N e^{\im \phi_j}}
  \label{eq:order_parameter}
\end{equation}
This parameter ranges from zero to one, inclusive,
and represents how coherent the population is,
with $r=1$ for completely coherent and $r = 0$ completely incoherent.

Finally, we need a way to quantify
the chimera-like quality of the population.
To compare with the analysis of \citet{hizanidis2016chimera},
we will utilize a pair of indices introduced
by \citet{shanahan2010metastable}.
First, we need to organize the game's nodes
into $M$ disjoint communities.
We split the nodes into $M=2$ communities $C_m$
by taking a subset
(the first \num{8E4} steps for computations ease)
of the simulation results
for the \gls{celegans} simulation with asymmetry $\alpha = \num{0.75}$.
We then calculate the covariance matrix $K_{i,j}$ of the strategy indices
(ensuring that communicative ($C$, $\phi_i$)
and non-communicative ($N$, $\phi_i$) are treated distinctly)
and sum the covariance between each node and all of graph's nodes
(\ie{} the row-wise sums $\sum_i K_{i,j}$).
After finding the node with the maximum covariance sum
$cov_{\text{max}} \coloneqq \max_j{\sum_i K_{i,j}}$,
we form a community by all nodes $j$ with covariance-sum
at least \SI{81}{\percent} of the maximum,
$\sum_i K_{i,j} \ge \num{0.81} cov_{\text{max}}$.
Finally, we place all the remaining nodes in a second community.

With these disjoint communities $C_m$, we then calculate
the time-dependent, community-wise order parameter $\rho_m(t)$
as
\begin{equation}
  \rho_m(t) \coloneqq \frac{1}{N_m} \abs{\sum_{j \in C_m} e^{\im \phi_j}}
\end{equation}
across members $j$ of community $C_m$ with size $N_m$.
Then, we define a chimera-like index $\chi$
\begin{equation}
  \chi = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{chi}}}_T
    \text{\qquad with \qquad}
    \sigma_{\text{chi}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{M-1} \sum_{m=1}^M
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_M}^2
  \label{eq:chimera_index}
\end{equation}
and a metastability index $\lambda$
\begin{equation}
  \lambda = \aab{
    \sigma_{\text{met}}}_M
    \text{\qquad with \qquad}
    \sigma_{\text{met}} \coloneqq \frac{1}{T-1} \sum_{t=1}^T
    \pab{\rho_m(t) - \aab{\rho_m(t)}_T}^2
  \label{eq:metastability_index}
\end{equation}
The chimera-like index measures the difference in coherence between communities:
complete homogeneity between communities
(\eg{} all fully synchronized \emph{or} fully desynchronized)
corresponds to $\chi = 0$,
while having two equally-sized communities
with one fully synchronized and one fully desynchronized
for all times yields a maximum $\chi = 2/7 \approx \num{0.29}$.
Likewise, the metastability index $\lambda$ measures how metastable
the system is (\ie{} transiting between synchronicity and desynchronicity).
A system that is fully synchronized or desynchronized gives $\lambda = 0$,
while spending equal times in each states yields $\lambda = 1/12 \approx \num{0.08}$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Complete graphs}
\label{sec:complete_graph}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/graph_multi-comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0$
    for different values of the payoff asymmetry $\alpha$.
    The network topology is the
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the asymmetry is $\alpha=3/4$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    the $B_0$ step size is \num{0.04},
    the in-phase benefit $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$ at each step,
    and the simulation was run for \num{2E8} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:graph_multi-comm-frac}
\end{figure}

First, we will explore the influence of the newly introduced asymmetry
on the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:multi-comm-frac}, we re-analyze the $N=20$ well-mixed population
originally analyzed in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
There, we compare the frequency of communicative strategies, $f_{\text{comm}}$,
to the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0$.
The $\alpha=1/2$ case corresponds to, and reproduces,
the \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} setup.
We can see it has low $f_{\text{comm}}$ for small $B_0$,
rises to $f_{\text{comm}} = 1/2$ at $B_0 \approx 0.21$
(corresponding to the $B_0 = 2 (N-1) c/(N-2)$ condition
found by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}),
and plateaus to $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 1$ for large $B_0$.
We also see that increasing (decreasing)
the asymmetry $\alpha$ dilates (stretches) this sigmoid function
in the $B_0$ direction.
In particular, for the smaller $\alpha$'s, the $f_{\text{comm}}$ curve
rises more steeply and at smaller values of $B_0$.

\subsection{\glsfmtshort{celegans} graphs}
\label{sec:elegans_graph}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{tikz/comm-frac.tikz}
  \caption{
    Time-averaged fraction of players that are communicative as a function
    of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0$.
    The blue dots represent the simulation results,
    the solid orange line represents the full $k$-regular, analytic estimate,
    and the dashed red line represents the small-$B_0$ $k$-regular approximation.
    The network topology is the

    and the simulation was run for \num{2E8} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:comm-frac}
\end{figure}

Here, we consider the $N=300$ weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
\Cref{fig:comm-frac} shows the fraction of players
using communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaged across
the entire simulation of \num{2E8} time steps as a function
of the maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0$.
These plots shows the fraction for the
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}
$N=20$ well-mixed and
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.
In addition, two variants of the full weighted, directed \gls{celegans}
connectome are shown:
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted} \emph{directed} but unweighted case
and
a \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected} \emph{weighted} but undirected case.
The plots used a selection strength of $\delta=0.2$
and an asymmetry of $\alpha=3/4$.
The blue dots represent the numerical simulation results across eleven
values of $B_0$.
The solid orange line represents the full analytic
result (\pcref{eq:full_analytic}) for a well-mixed population
with the well-mixed indegree $n-1$ replaced by the average
indegree: \num{19} for the well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
and \num{13.36} for the \gls{celegans} cases
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}--\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}.
Finally, the red dotted line represents the first term
of the analytic result~(\pcref{eq:analytic_first_term}).

The well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed} shows a logistic curve
qualitatively similar to that shown in \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
While the \citet{tripp2022evolutionary} case ($\alpha = 1/2$)
crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ near $B_0 = 0.21$,
the plot here (with $\alpha = 3/4$) is compressed to the $y$-axis
and crosses $f_{\text{comm}} = 0.5$ around $B_0 = 0.12$.
However, the \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
is qualitatively distinct.
Here, we see that population is nearly universally non-communicative
for $B_0 \le 0.08$,
followed by an immediate jump to a maximum communicative fraction
of \num{0.77} around $B_0 = 1.6$.
This communicative fraction then slowly declines
to a horizontal asymptote around \num{0.60}.
While the orang line representing the analytic result
is a nearly perfect match for the well-mixed case \subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
the \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} deviates significantly
from the simulation results.

In order to investigate the cause of the deviation
between simulation and theory
in the full \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full},
we next look at variations to the \gls{celegans} network topology.
First, the \emph{directed}, unweighted connectome
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-unweighted}
is qualitatively similar to the well-mixed case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed}.
While the blue simulation results exhibit a steeper rise
than the orange theory results,
the directed case still shows a monotonic increase
from low communication for $B_0 < 0.1$
to full communication for $B_0 \ge 0.2$.
This implies that the quality of directedness
plays a relatively small role in the qualitative shape
of the full \gls{celegans} case \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}.
On the other hand,
the \emph{weighted}, undirected connectome
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
looks quite similar to the full \gls{celegans} case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}.
In particular, this weighted case
\subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-undirected}
shows the same plateau at $f_{\text{comm}} \approx 0.7$
seen in the full \gls{celegans} case,
though the ``peak'' around $B_0 - 0.15$ is less pronounced.
This similarity implies that the connectome's edge weights
are the most relevant aspect influencing the deviation
of the \gls{celegans} \subref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full}
simulation results in blue from the theory results in orange.

\subsubsection{Game types}
\begin{figure}

  \caption{

    (given by the interaction graph edge weight),
    expressed as a fraction of all games played,

    The game types are color-coded according to the legend.
    The network topology is the
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed}}
    $N=20$ well-mixed population
    and
    \protect{\subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full}}

    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    $B_0$ is \num{0.15},
    $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$,
    and the simulation was run for \num{8E6} time steps.
  }
  \label{fig:game-type}
\end{figure}

Next, we would like to understand the types of games being played
during the population's evolution.
In \cref{fig:game-type}, we consider the most common game type
amongst all player interactions.
Note that a player pair's game type is determined solely
by their relative phase $\Delta \phi$ and is independent
of the players' communicativeness, by definition.
At each time step, we determine the most common game types
across all player interactions,
where the number of interactions between two players
is the corresponding edge weight of the interaction graph.
Finally, \cref{fig:game-type} shows what fraction of time
a given game type is the plurality for different values
of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
\Cref{fig:game-type_well-mixed}
shows the fraction for the
$N=20$ well-mixed,
and
\cref{fig:game-type_celegans-full}
\gls{celegans} connectome network topologies.

\Cref{fig:game-type} shows qualitative differences
between the different network topologies.
The \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the time evolution for each asymmetry $\alpha$
is dominated by a single game type
occurring for over \SI{99.9}{\percent} of the time steps.
This is in contrast with the
\subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} connectome case,
where the deadlock type game is most common
for \SIrange{10}{15}{\percent} of the time steps
for asymmetry $\alpha \le 0.5$.
Nevertheless, both \subref{fig:game-type_well-mixed} well-mixed
and \subref{fig:game-type_celegans-full} have the same dominant game types
across asymmetries:
dilemma for $\alpha = 0, 0.25$, chicken for $\alpha = 0.5$,
hero for $\alpha = 0.75$, and deadlock for $\alpha = 1$.
This shows that, as the asymmetry is varied,
different game types dominate the population's evolution
and network topology influences how dominant these game types are.

\subsubsection{Time series}

    and the simulation was run for \num{8E6} time steps.

  \label{fig:time-series}
\end{figure}

While \cref{fig:comm-frac,fig:game-type} displayed
the time-averaged system state,
it is also useful to investigate the time-dependent variations.
As before, \cref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} shows the results
for a well-mixed population of $N=20$ players
while \cref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} depicts the results
for the \gls{celegans} connectome.
\Cref{fig:time-series} depicts the frequency
of communicative strategies $f_{\text{comm}}$
as a scatter plot of time on the left vertical axis.
These time-series points are color-coded
grey if all players are communicative or
black if all players are non-communicative;
otherwise, the points are colored according
to the plurality game type as indicated in the legend.
On the right vertical axis,
a magenta line plot depicts the order parameter
given by \cref{eq:order_parameter} and
taking values in the range $[0,1]$,
where $\phi_j$ is the phase of the $j$-th player.
These simulations were run with
for \num{8E6} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
asymmetry $\alpha = 3/4$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0 = 0.15$,
and maximum benefit of unilateral communication $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$.

The \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case
shows that the system incredibly homogeneous.
Temporary drops in communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$
and order parameter $\rho$ are likely the result of mutations,
which are expected to occur, on average, every $1/\mu = \num{1E4}$ time steps.
But the system quickly returns to uniformity;
for the parameters and timespan depicted here,
the system spends a majority of its time in the communicative regime.
Indeed, as shown in \cref{fig:comm-frac_well-mixed},
this simulation with $B_0 = 0.15$ should be be in the communicative regime
approximately \SI{75}{\percent} of the time.
In contrast, the \subref{fig:time-series_celegans-full} \gls{celegans} case
depicts a far more heterogeneous population.
Here, the population never stabilizes to fully communicative or non-communicative.
Instead, both its communicative frequency and order parameter
stay between \SIrange{40}{70}{\percent}.
With a communicative frequency $f_{\text{comm}}$ averaging approximately \SI{60}{\percent},
this is similar to the $f_{\text{comm}} \approx \SI{70}{\percent}$ seen
in \cref{fig:comm-frac_celegans-full} with $B_0 = 0.15$.
The difference is reflective of this particular \num{8E6} subset
of the \num{2E8} runtime in \cref{fig:comm-frac}.
While the \subref{fig:time-series_well-mixed} well-mixed case,
the \gls{celegans} case shows less stability to mutations.
Instead of the uniform player communicatively interrupted
impulsive disturbances,
the \gls{celegans} case depicts heterogeneous communicativeness
with occasional, discontinuous jumps.
Again, these are most likely the results of mutations introduced
to the population.

\subsubsection{Chimera-like index}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \pgfplotsset{width=0.4\textwidth}
  \input{tikz/chimera-index.tikz}
  \caption{
    The chimera-like index (\pcref{eq:chimera_index}, left axis, solid line)
    and metastability index (\pcref{eq:metastability_index},
    right axis, dashed line)
    as functions of the asymmetry $\alpha$
    for the
    weighted, directed \gls{celegans} connectome.
    The indices were calculated after splitting the graph
    into two communities according to the nodes' relative covariance
    for the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ simulation
    and grouped according to whether the sum
    of a nodes relative covariances above
    \SI{81}{\percent} of the maximum covariance sum.
    The selection strength is $\delta=0.2$,
    the mutation rate is $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
    the cost $c$ is \num{0.1},
    $B_0$ is \num{0.15},
    $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$,
    and the simulation was run for \num{8E6} time steps.
    Note the differing vertical axis scales
    for the left and right axes.
  }
  \label{fig:chimera-index}
\end{figure}

Observing animations of the system's time evolution,
the authors noted a subset of the nodes exhibiting high synchronicity
while others remained incoherent: a chimera state.
In order to quantify this effect, we will investigate
the chimera-like index $\chi$ \cref{eq:chimera_index}
and metastability index $\lambda$ \cref{eq:metastability_index}.
As discussed in \cref{sec:stats_setup},
we first split the players into $M=2$ distinct communities
according to the row-wise sum of the covariance matrix
between the players' strategies for the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ case.
Next, we calculate the average time-dependent community-wise
order parameter $\rho_m(t)$
for each community $m$ and find the $\lambda$ and $\chi$
as the temporal- or community-wise- covariance of
$\rho_m(t)$, respectively.
\Cref{fig:chimera-index} shows these results
as functions of the asymmetry $\alpha$.
The left vertical axis depicts the chimera-like index $\chi$
in a solid line,
while the right vertical axis shows the metastability index
in a dashed line.
These simulations were run with
for \num{8E6} time steps with
selection strength $\delta = 0.2$,
mutation rate $\mu=\num{1E-4}$,
cost $c = \num{0.1}$,
maximum benefit of mutual communication $B_0 = 0.15$,
and maximum benefit of unilateral communication $\beta_0$ is $\num{0.95} B_0$.

The metastability displayed in \cref{fig:chimera-index}
is quite low at $\le \num{0.01}$ compared
to a theoretical maximum of \num{0.08}.
This implies that the system is rather stable
and spends most of its time at a fairly constant
synchronicity $\rho_m(t)$.
Furthermore, while the metastability is higher (more unstable)
at $\approx \num{0.01}$ for the $\alpha = 0$ case,
the metastability drops precipitously for larger $\alpha$,
always staying below \num{0.004} implying that
asymmetry makes the system more stable.
On the other hand, the chimera-like index $\chi$
attains fairly large values indicating a high chimeric quality.
The chimera-like index $\chi$ varies between \num{0.06} and \num{0.13}.
Considering a theoretical maximum of \num{0.28},
the system is quite chimeric at nearly half the maximum.
Given that the chimera-like index is averaged over time,
this deviation from complete a chimera state
arise from both imperfect separation of the coherent/incoherent populations
as well as time fluctuations in the chimera quality.
While we observe that $\chi$ is a maximum at $\alpha = \num{0.75}$,
we caution that this is likely the result of calculating the communities
based off the $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ covariances.
The fact that $\chi$ remains elevated for the other asymmetries $\alpha$
implies that this particular community decomposition
corresponds to an intrinsic separation rather than an artifact
of the particular $\alpha = \num{0.75}$ simulation.

\subsection{Payoff asymmetry}
Payoff asymmetry was one of the new extensions
we added to the evolutionary Kuramoto dynamics
of \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}.
It is therefore instructive to discuss the overall impacts
of this asymmetry $\alpha$.
\Cref{fig:multi-comm-frac} shows that increasing asymmetry
makes communication more favorable, as would be expected.
The mechanism for this population-wide shift
is hinted at by \cref{fig:game-type}:
changing $\alpha$ directly impacts the payoff matrix
\cref{eq:payoff-matrix}.
If we start from the traditional $\alpha = 1/2$ case,
we see that the particular values of $B_0 = 0.15$
and $c = 0.1$ gives a payoff matrix of
\begin{equation}
\begin{bNiceMatrix}[first-col,first-row,hvlines]
  & C, \phi_j & N, \phi_j \\
  C, \phi_i & 0.15 f(\Delta \phi) - 0.1 &  0.95 (0.15) f(\Delta \phi) - 0.1 \\
  N, \phi_i & 0.95 (0.15) f(\Delta \phi) & 0
\end{bNiceMatrix}
\end{equation}
This has a game type of chicken for $f(\Delta \phi) > 40/57 \approx \num{0.70}$,
dilemma for $2/3 < f(\Delta \phi) < 40/57$,
and deadlock for $0 < f(\Delta \phi) < 2/3$.
For $f(\Delta \phi) = [1+\cos(\Delta \phi)]/2$,
and $m=20$ phases, we have chicken games for seven $\Delta \phi$
and deadlock for 13 $\Delta \phi$.
While more $\Delta \phi$ differences correspond to deadlock,
the exponential fixation time
of chicken-type games~\citep{antal2006fixation}
ensures that the vast majority of the simulation is spent on chicken games.
Decreasing $\alpha$ to $0.25$ or $0$
only permits dilemma type games for $2/3 < f(\Delta \phi)$ (7 deltas)
and deadlock games for $f(\Delta \phi) < 2/3$ (13 deltas).
Increasing $\alpha$ to \num{0.75}
hero from $80/171 < f(\Delta \phi) < 2/3$: this one is exponential
Finally, increasing $\alpha$ to $1$

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we extended the evolutionary Kuramoto model
introduced by \citet{tripp2022evolutionary}
to include structured interaction and reproduction graphs
as well as an asymmetry between
the communicator and non-communicator payoffs.
We first applied this model to a well-mixed population
and found that increasing (decreasing) the asymmetry
inhibits (promotes) communicativity.
Next, we applied the model to
a family of graphs deriving from the \gls{celegans} connectome,
including: the full directed, weighted graph;
an unweighted, directed graph;
and an undirected, weighted graph.
This revealed that the graph's directedness
had a minor effect of steepening the transition
from non-communicative to communicative
as the maximum benefit of mutual communication was increased.
However, the weightedness of the graph had a much more drastic effect
on the population by strongly suppressing the maximum communicativity.
For the weighted connectome graphs (both directed and undirected),
the communicative frequency asymptote decreased from unity
to approximately \num{0.7} for large $B_0$.
Finally, we found qualitative differences between the composition
of the well-mixed populations and the \gls{celegans} populations.
While the well-mixed players had largely homogeneous populations
that occasionally switched between fully communicative
and fully non communicative,
the \gls{celegans} population remained far more heterogenous
with a stable, chimeric mix of both communicators and non-communicators.
This chimera state in a model of the \gls{celegans} brain connectome
was suggestive of prior studies finding chimera states in human brains.
Potential avenues of future research include applying the model
to larger connectomes such as that
of \gls{dmelanogaster}~\citep{schlegel2024whole}.
Additionally, it could prove fruitful to analytically study
the dynamics of game types as a function of the payoff asymmetry
to better understand any long-run attractor game types.
